Of course this movie is very political correct (\"strong women\" in the beginning -.- ) and US propaganda (of course USA is allowed to bomb enemy nuclear **** problem). And some of the scenes resembled too much to the first Top Gun. In the beginning I was even thinking if I downloaded the right movie, lol.

He puts other actors inside a moving fighter jet. He enters one himself. And it's to fly! Beautiful until the last minute. I can only fill every second of this job with praise. Every character is fun. The only core that doesn't fit is that of Tom Cruise with Jennifer Connelly. It took just one step to wrap that core in the gripping narrative.

It also sets the bar on how to do a reboot and I'm sure will make a lot of people think about signing up to the Navy.

Yes, it's Top Gun: Maverick time. The sequel you have been waiting almost 40 years for, which was supposed to come out 2 years ago, is finally here. Now, I have never seen the original film, but I was keen to see what all the hype around this sequel was about. Tom Cruise has made good choices over the years and he's always going full tilt in these action roles, so I didn't expect for this to disappoint. Here's how it goes.\r\n\r\nEven though Top Gun: Maverick is a present-day sequel to the original Top Gun (1986), the movie really leans into that old-fashioned, 1980's action film vibe.

All actors from Tom Cruise to the younger crew do an exceptional job in their acting. The real jet fighter scenes really encapsulate the jaw dropping moments during several parts in the film. The revamped volleyball scene does not disappoint either. And the film ending with Gaga's epic ballad really seals the deal."}

The military hardware was great to see in motion and everything just \"felt\" right with a lot of throwbacks to the earlier film as well as this one forging its own path.  Fun, poignant and great action. A review score seems almost arbitrary as I'll buy this on 4 k when released. So if you liked the first Top Gun you'll like this one.  9.9/10. Go see it then go and buy it on your favourite format when it's released. 25/5/2022."}
