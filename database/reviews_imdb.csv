pucciarello,"May 28, 2022",9,"Paid for the whole seat, but only used the edge
I'll preface my review by first stating that I had mediocre expectations coming in. It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.

1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.

2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.

3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.

This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter."
nihal-38544,"May 25, 2022",9,"TOM CRUISE YOU LEGEND!
This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes."
r96sk,"May 25, 2022",9,"What an excellent sequel
What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.

'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.

The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.

Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.

Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.

A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already."
scottedwards-87359,"May 26, 2022",10,"This is slightly different to the other reviews, please stay with me here.
If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.

Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.

This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.

I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you."
lovefalloutkindagamer,"May 26, 2022",10,"Let me just say...
I was reluctantly dragged into the theater, thinking that they didn't need to make a Top Gun 2 and that the first one was where that story needed to end.

I could write a couple paragraphs to summarize my feelings after walking out of the theater, but I'm going to leave it with just one sentence.

I was wrong."
Top_Dawg_Critic,"May 23, 2022",10,"The truly epic blockbuster we needed.
Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.

Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.

The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.

There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me."
alexglimbergwindh,"May 30, 2022",10,"The real cinema experience!

moviesfilmsreviewsinc,"May 25, 2022",10,"Best Sequel yet
In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions."
dtucker86,"May 27, 2022",10,"This is why we go to the movies
This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!"
Stoshie,"Jun 18, 2022",7,"Great Flight Sequences, Cliche-Ridden Plot
I don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.

The problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny's window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.

The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.

There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.

Did I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.

I will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.

So, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don't pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster."
DVR_Brale,"Jun 4, 2022",10,"A perfect gift to all Top Gun fans
There are so many references to the original that I was brought to childhood when I had first seen it.

Horror_Flick_Fanatic,"Aug 24, 2022",6,"Not bad, but waayy overrated.
Based on the scores, I was expecting a much better film. But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.

Here is my take and why I think its an ""okay"" film, just not a great one. There really isn't a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It's largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer, younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn't have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain's summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.

Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn't be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn't aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.

The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn't feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That's a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.

What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn't think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.

I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it's a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don't end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world."
DarkVulcan29,"May 27, 2022",10,"Flying High
Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.

Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.

Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait."
cruise01,"May 29, 2022",10,"Tom Cruise really knows how a blockbuster film is made.
5 out of 5 stars.

Top Gun Maverick is an awesome action film that lives up to the original film and way superior as well. It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.

The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.

The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.

The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.

The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.

The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.

Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres."
thesar-2,"May 29, 2022",9,"This Topped and Outgunned the Original
See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.

The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.

Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.

What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.

While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.

The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.

If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.

And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.

I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.

kosmasp,"May 30, 2022",10,"Talk to me Goose
It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.

There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.

Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.

Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.

There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.

First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy."
ferguson-6,"May 24, 2022",8,"we get what we hoped for
Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.

Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the ""Top Gun"" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.

Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.

Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of ""Goose"" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.

The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.

We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.

Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.

Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.

Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022."

I went into this film with very high expectations. The film delivered plenty at many times, but others I found myself quite bored.

I was tempted to write out all the issues I had that took away the 3 stars, but this film is really just a fun, happy thing that everyone loves and isn't arguing about, and how often do we get that?

So I'll just say it's worth the watch and leave it at that."
HalBanksy,"May 31, 2022",10,"Puts a smile on your face!
What a rush. Lucky enough to watch this is on a Dolby screen - a thrilling cinema experience. Outstanding direction and editing. The genuine aerial stunts really put to shame the endless CGI tripe that is slopped into theatres every week. The action here feels viscerally REAL - something that has been sorely missed from recent blockbusters.

The new cast are all perfect. It's obvious they are having the time of their lives - and that infectious joy was felt by the whole audience. Charming, funny, arrogant and heartful at all the right times. I hope we will see them reunited on screen (and much sooner than 36 years!) The nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise does not look out of place. The practical flying scenes really cannot be praised enough. It's an action masterclass, I can barely fathom the work and effort it took to capture such ambitious footage.

The film is self-aware and knows exactly what the audience is there to see. Clearly a better script than the original (although lacking the iconic quotes.) Killing off Meg Ryan seemed a bit unnecessary, especially after they made the effort to bring back Val Kilmer for a quite jarring cameo. Honestly the references to the original were slightly overkill to begin with, but thankfully settled down once the plot got going.

I thought the film had come to a very satisfying climax, then a happy surprise to realise the final act was only just beginning! You can't deny that Tom Cruise pulled it off - a real movie star, in a real blockbuster hit. Oscars for sound, cinematography and editing are surely locked down. Simply the best film of 2022."
damianphelps,"Nov 17, 2022",7,"Top Gun: The Force Awakens
Firstly before my small complaint I will point out that I do like the movie.

Now the complaint. This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.

Having said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well. It was also great to see Kilmer, despite his current health concerns (he could have been a dynamo for the film if well).

Its fun, loud and obnoxious which is what a Top Gun movie should be :)"

Greetings from Lithuania.

I wasn't the biggest fan of first ""Top Gun"" movie. I saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn't nostalic or anything. It was just OK movie and nothing more.

Today i saw ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.

Overall, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel."

UniqueParticle,"May 31, 2022",10,"Holy cow such a great IMAX experience!
Tom Cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. I like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well."
sambitswain,"May 23, 2022",10,"Worth the wait
Really!! It's amazing how something so good and looked forward to was above expectation. Amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Tom Cruise and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Tom Cruise is a machine. He knows what audiences want and he delivers. Not sure how they can top this one (but I thought the same after watching him cling onto a plane).

You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the fans out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience. Go see it you wont regret it.

Perfection doesn't deserve a remake. It deserves a re-watch."

Just Saw This In IMAX and guys what an experience it was.

Components of this Movie-

1. Firstly what a cast! EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER seemed like they were having a Great Time Acting in this movie. INCLUDING the serious minded Admirals. Great Performances all around.

2. Every Scene flows so well. The time flew by.

3. Many of the Jokes Landed Strongly throughout the Movie with the audience I was with. Especially the ""You Told Me Not to Think"" Scene. 😂🤣

4. The Visuals of the Fighter Jet Scenes were Astonishing. They looked so good.

5. The Story was good enough, on top of that, the suspense was built up throughout towards the Actual Mission. With The Training Missions and Different Conundrums the Team Faced.

Overall, What A Movie and Going Further, What an Experience it was."
masonsaul,"May 28, 2022",10,"One of the best sequels ever
Top Gun: Maverick accomplishes a very rare feat of being a long gestating sequel that is not only worthy of the original but actually better than it. Managing to retain the spirit of the original whilst also adding stronger stakes, a more emotionally involving narrative and better written characters.

Tom Cruise is perfect as Maverick, bringing all the charm and star power but also adding much needed dramatic weight and sorrow to the character. He also has great chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, who is a strong love interest with lots of warmth and humanity.

All of the new cast fit in perfectly and are all really memorable but Miles Teller is definitely the standout with a satisfying character arc and has equally great chemistry with Cruise. Val Kilmer's inclusion was a superb decision and is handled with immense love and respect.

Joseph Kosinski's direction is absolutely amazing. The film looks amazing overall with some nice homages to Tony Scott's iconic style but the standout is definitely the flight sequences which are truly astonishing and satisfyingly practical.

Sifting through hours upon hours of footage, the flight sequences are edited together in spectacular fashion, extremely comprehensible and never boring. The film itself has excellent pacing, naturally building to a thrilling climax that just keeps escalating.

The soundtrack and music by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga and Hans Zimmer is also perfect. All the classics you expect are present and used in satisfying ways and the new music is appropriately epic. The new songs by Lada Gaga and One Republic are so good, utilised at the right moments and equally catchy and memorable."
radhrh,"Jun 13, 2022",6,"More corn than the Jolly Green Giant
I drove an hour each way to see this in a movie theater, my first visit to one a couple of years because I wanted to get the full cinematic experience. What I got was a huge pile of corn. If not for the flying sequences, which are awesome, the rest of the movie is a bit pants. Ed Harris is in it for a single scene, more of a cameo role than anything. Val Kilmer's scene was embarrassing. Jennifer Connelly is looking her age and plays a half baked love interest which frankly the film could have done without. Is she supposed to be the Kelly McGillis role from the original movie? She lives in a very similar house and she drives a Porsche so who knows? The plot revolves around a mission so uniquely unlikely that it makes the movie slightly preposterous. The cast of pilots don't hold a candle to the original cast and their characters are two dimensional and boring. It isn't Tom Cruise's best performance either playing the eponymous Maverick, a man still plagued by the death of his buddy, Goose from the first movie. Come on, man. That was 35 years ago, get over it FFS! Jon Hamm, who I normally like doesn't look comfortable playing Maverick's up tight commander and there's a scene of beach football which is supposed to mirror the volleyball scene from the first movie but just looks gay AF. Once again the flying scenes are unbelievable, by that I mean extremely believable. The actors must have actually been in the planes for at least some of the shots and CGI has been kept to a minimum which is great to see. But take away those sequences, which don't account for much run time, maybe 15% of total run time, and what you have left is quite poor."

Nothing new here. Slow burner of a movie. Last ten minutes of entertainment.

All the rest is just time filler for that last ten minutes.

Cannot believe the higher than average ratings this movie is getting.

Wow!

I have just walked out of the cinema, and feel absolutely buzzing, a two hour thrill ride, what a spectacular movie this was.

I so often feel disappointed by hyped up films, but this deserves all the hype, and then some.

Top Gun is a classic, one of those films we've all seen, and many love. When I first heard about a follow up, I dreaded it, so many films have diabolical follow ups, almost damaging the original, definitely not the case here though, this is a great movie.

All involved were outstanding, Tom Cruise, clearly a perfectionist, and that side of him is evident here, I cannot find a single fault.

Visually amazing, great music, great story, superb acting.

Nailed it! 10/10."
jerrycoliver,"May 30, 2022",9,"A remake that actually worked
So I can't give it 10 stars because ultimately it is a remake or sequel however you prefer to look at it. It falls into the same traps these films do with too many callbacks and rehashed scenes.

That said, there is a very honest story about changing times and aging which ultimately drives the movie. Good cinema is subtle about real world situations (best example being Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. People not watching it when it was released probably would miss all the commentary on politics from the era.) So in that sense it's pretty bold and genuine.

The flight sequences are...outstanding. It was mostly shot practically which is why is looks so much more impressive than other movies. Directing is good, not great (sans the action sequences, which are great.) Acting is great. Connelly, Cruise and Teller are all A-listers for a reason. So anyone who says ""there's nothing good about this movie"" are just haters. You can't by any stretch of criticism say the action sequences and acting aren't some of the best you'll see all year.

It is very much a throwback to blockbusting movies from the 80's and it really feels like it. But we haven't had that in so long, it was nice to revisit it. I don't think it's one of the greatest movies of all times, but I gave it a 9 because it could be the greatest movie from the last 3-4 years. It didn't ask you to have watched a bunch of other movies to appreciate it (like Marvel) it wasn't preachy with its messaging, it didn't drag, it was humanizing but indulgent with drama. Just a perfect summer movie for the times."

Drew9494,"Aug 28, 2022",8,"This is what we want. (not politics and social justice)
This is how you do a sequel. Top Gun: Maverick, is a surprisingly good time, specially given the current state of Hollywood. In some ways, it's even better than the original. It's also bittersweet, because it represents an America that no longer exists. It represents the end of an era, in many ways.

Having said that, it's a solid 8.5 for me, and well worth the money.

What else to say? The scenes with the f-18s are beautiful. Specially considering, most of them are 100% real. (no CGI) Tom Cruise, is Tom Cruise. Great acting, as always. Same goes for the rest of the cast. Pretty much all the roles were well acted.

Basically my only problem with the first Top Gun is the relationship between Maverick and Charlie, the love story, i'm fine with them at first but later on i don't care anymore, that's it, the rest of the first Top Gun was badass, it was great and it was fascinating, Top Gun: Maverick, a long wait sequel, my first problem with this movie is nothing, zero, and yes there is still a love story in this one but i like it, it did not bother me at all, i'm fine with it, is it necessary? No, but Jennifer Connelly performance is convincing enough, the rest of Top Gun: Maverick is a visually well done film, the movie succeed to make me feel so intense and it's really probably the most intense feeling i got in a non-horror movie, the movie is also surprisingly emotionally moving, Maverick is never been a guy that i was that adored, and as a character a fanatic, but somehow someway i feel like i was know him longer than ever, i feel closer to him more than ever, and i was care to him way more than ever, all the new Top Gun team is as exciting as the previous one and probably even more, Miles Teller is really the second best performance in here next to Tom Cruise, a very very powerful performances by Miles Teller, the music like the first one was great, the score, and of course the whole plane sequence was just terrific, overall Top Gun: Maverick is one of those movie that you have to watch in the theaters not only because it's a great movie but the sound and the visual is a big screen only experience, it's a way better movie than the first one too, i loved every second of this movie, it is truly a very emotional ride, it's a very fun ride, it's a very intense ride, and at in the end the whole movie is a fantastic ride, Top Gun: Maverick is so far for me the best films of the year."
Fluke_Skywalker,"May 27, 2022",8,"Cruise remains a Top Gun
Hollywood had lost its way long before streaming services and a global pandemic nearly made going to the cinema obsolete. Content to strip mine the comic book genre and reboot/reimagine and regurgitate beloved franchises, it had become stale and tired. It's ironic then that a sequel to a nearly 40 year old film (You read that right. Scary isn't it?) might be the thing that points the way to their salvation.

Top Gun: Maverick is a totally unnecessary film and on the surface it would seem to be Hollywood once again gnawing on a bone long since picked clean of any meat. The original Top Gun didn't exactly leave us with a bunch of unresolved issues or end on a cliffhanger. Just because a movie is good doesn't mean it needs a sequel. But here we are. And damn if they don't just manage to make it worthwhile, if still unnecessary.

Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same story beats as the original, but the tone here is far less... 80s. Fitting as it's not, well, the 80s. That doesn't mean it's some sort of post-modern deconstruction of the titualar character or a naval gazing treatise. It's got plenty of humor and, most important of all, it isn't saddled with preaching a ""woke"" message or poking us in the chest with some ideological finger. It's a movie that just wants to entertain, and entertain it does.

Whatever you or I may think of Tom Cruise's ""religious"" beliefs, I dare anyone to say that there is an actor working today who brings the kind of passion and commitment to excellence to everything the way he does. He truly is the last real movie star, and I find myself appreciating him more and more with each passing year.

My quibbles are just that. The romance between Cruise's Maverick and the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly's Penny is a tad perfunctory, even though they do share a nice chemistry and Connelly is particularly good. The enemy is also faceless and nameless, likely in an attempt to not offend any particular market; though to be fair this was also the case in the original.

But these minor issues aside, Top Gun: Maverick is a refreshing throwback to a time when Summer films were fun, and after nearly 20 years of increasingly banal comic book, cgi shennanigans, it really hit the spot that much more."
sudiniup,"Aug 27, 2022",7,"Flying scenes good
Sorry, but I thought this was a boring movie. It was nostalgic, but it was also boring. The flight scenes and action scenes were great. But the dialogue was dull, full of cliched sentences. I don't think the writers on top of their game, and it's a shame because this could have been a very good movie, it needed better writing. Even the music was not inspiring. I don't know why this movie has such high ratings, probably the nostalgia and flying action was truly outstanding. It was good to see Tom Cruise in action again, he is a true star and a it seems he can do anything. I wish he had hired better writers for the dialogue."
zkonedog,"May 30, 2022",10,"What The Cinematic Experience Is All About
In recent years, developments like cheap large-screen TVs, internet fast enough to support seamless streaming content, and work-from-home edicts/trends have rendered film largely a stay-at-home experience. There are certainly some pros to this: cheap snacks, on-demand viewing, and not having to venture out into the general public for mass-consumption of entertainment. But all that said, there is still something about the cinematic experience that captures the imagination--the big screen, the immersive sound, the live reactions/buzz, and the conversations afterward. Just the opportunity to ""get out"" might be underrated at this point. For all of us who enjoy such excursions and want more of them in the future, Top Gun: Maverick is the film we all needed.

For a very basic overview, Maverick tells the story of the titular Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), still breaking in cutting-edge flying machines with no designs on sitting behind a desk. But in a world that has perhaps moved on from his ways, Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to help train a new class--including one Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), whose name may sound familiar to fans of the original 1986 effort--for a seemingly impossible mission. Along the way, he rekindles a relationship with an old flame (played by Jennifer Connelly) and comes to terms with some unfinished business--both emotionally and in the skies.

First and foremost, TG: Maverick is a 10/10 film--and easily, at that--because it perfectly balances the ""new stuff"" with the legacy material. Five minutes in, I knew that Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski had the right formula. There is not a single wasted or boring moment here. Not only that, but the focus is squarely on Cruise's Maverick pretty much throughout (as the title might suggest). This isn't some cheap handoff to a ""new crew"" with Cruise shepherding the transition. This is a down-and-dirty, perfectly planned out melding of old and new.

Cinematically, I can count on one hand (if that) the number of times I've been as enthralled from a theater seat. The phrase ""see it on the biggest screen possible"" might be bit trite, but in this case it couldn't ring more true (I saw it in IMAX format and was completely blown away!). The cinematography is one-of-a-kind, the sound reverberates through the entire theater, and the drama/laughs are palpable throughout. I can definitively state--beyond a shadow of a doubt--that seeing TGM in a theater is better than any home theater setup imaginable. It simply was created for the theater experience.

A final movie-specific observation: the ability of this film to garner tears, laughs, and thrills in equal measure is nearly unparalleled. Everything it does--from re-introducing a legacy character hero, to the airborne theatrics, to the subtle or romantic character work--is crafted with incredible care and precision. There is something here for everyone (another cinema hallmark, come to think of it).

It is easy--and sometimes popular--to write off Cruise's work due to some of his personal foibles. At this point, however, one does that at his/her own risk. Is he now the greatest cinematic star of all time? Unanswerable question, of course, but Top Gun: Maverick puts him in the conversation, to be sure. Without his dogged persistence in making sure this flick wasn't unceremoniously dumped onto a streaming platform, who knows what may have become of it (through all the delays and hand-wringing).

Movies like this one definitively prove that the experience remains viable in the current entertainment environment (both for quality and money-making ability). The future of cinema is still murky, to be sure, but as Maverick himself intones about his supposedly impending extinction: ""Maybe so, sir...but not today""."
RedRoadster,"Jun 9, 2022",6,"Take me on the mighty wings tonight ....... again.
I'm old enough to remember seeing the original Top Gun at the cinema in 1986. From a nostalgic point of view, I cant believe 36 years have passed between then and this sequel.

The obvious observation to make is that Top Gun - Maverick is more a homage to the original film and characters than it is a sequel. The opening credits and aircraft carrier scene (with Kenny Logins Danger Zone blaring out) promises a treat but I'm afraid it falls short of expectations.

The major problem is that the wise cracking one liners, over the top egos and amazing soundtrack of the original is replaced here with a paper thin plot, elementary dialogue and minor character development. Even the ""mission"" itself is something these days that would have been executed with technology and without using fighter planes. Its also really sad to see Maverick and Iceman at the end of the road and the general sense that the young men we once saw playing volleyball are now relics who have become irrelevant. There is too much use of the original as a lead in to the plot points and even having Goose's son as a big part of the story feels more nostalgic than it does necessary. Maverick's rekindled love story with Penny Benjamin at Miramar is tender but convenient, (Still working in the base bar after all these years ?) but the character is entitled to a happy conclusion to his story arc.

As an action blockbuster it is really entertaining and with the cinema experience, the aerial sequences are gripping and very well done. Personally I would have liked to have seen more exterior shots during the action rather than facial closeups, but I suppose that was done to keep the characters identified during the chaotic final attack and dogfight.

All in all, Its a by the numbers follow on which probably should have been made 15 years ago or not all. I'm sure part of my disappointment is how much of a pop culture effect the first one had on my generation and that this is a pale imitation compared to it. Six out of ten might seem generous, but I guess I just don't want to ""lose that loving feeling""."

This film manages to portray the best of the characters and the original story.

The entire film is pure nostalgia, which reminds us of the story and characters of the original, but also giving rise to new characters and this new story, although it has many similarities with the original, the creators of this film understand all the characters and the previous film, portraying emotional and very moving moments. Some of the new characters don't get much development, but the familiar characters are just as charming as they were in the original. The scenes involving fighter planes are well done and the sound of them is spectacular, the special effects are very few, which is good, and they are good. The performances are good and can be very emotional.

It is a very good sequel, since it understands the story and the original characters, as well as the emotional moments that are very significant, just as the new story is very enjoyable, this sequel makes us have more affection for these characters and the original story."

LongTimeMovieLover,"Jun 4, 2022",8,"Very Good...Thank you, Tom Cruise
I would like to give this movie a 10, simply because Tom Cruise brought back something great to cinema. He should receive accolades. Thank you, Tom Cruise.

Finally, a wonderful non-Marvel/Disney action movie; I am so tired of the entire tired Marvel eco-system. We really have to admire Tom Cruise for this accomplishment. And, what he has done for the Armed Services in creating interest for selfless service to the interests of the USA, superb. Thank you, Tom Cruise.

I love watching Tom Cruise in interviews. He's so intense and focused. It is a lesson in drive, determination, and mind over matter. Just exceptional. He's now the guy at the top of my ""who would you like to have dinner with"" list. I really admire him; he's my own age, and I am adjunct faculty at two universities, one of which I teach in a graduate master degree program in leadership.

Now, apart from the emotion of my deserved admiration for Tom Cruise and his stellar accomplishment, I think this movie was a great night night out at the theater. This reminded me of Ford v. Ferrari, a good story that exhilarates. Yet, all in, similarly, a bit forgettable and predictable in the story. That is, when I watch a movie, I reflect on whether the movie teaches me something, or draws out of me some unforgettable emotion. Does it change me, like reading a meaningful book. Consider all the life lessons taught in Godfather I and II, or the seminar one-liners of Jerry McGuire, or the original Top Gun.

So, notwithstanding the unbelievable accomplishment of the sets, and planes, and jets, being crazy great, as the overall movie goes, I give it an 8, because it still misses the character development and relies on the original more than it perhaps should do. Truly, I want to give this movie a 10, because emotions tell me to do it for Tom Cruise, but the movie is really an 8, all in. But go see it on the big screen, it's really great cinema. Thank you, Tom Cruise. Do it at the theater to support the movie-making that Tom Cruise is doing. Great cinema, and not Marvel.

Really, deeply and sincerely, thank you, Tom Cruise."

While the beautiful aerial sequences are exceptionally filmed, and edited. The rest of the film is one giant cliche.

The acting, the storyline, script and even underscore all seemed phoned-in to me. My biggest issue is how, once again, Cruise's character has to be overly propped/hyped up, just like in Top Gun, just like in A few Good Men, just like in the Mission Impossible series: his character has to be the best and most celebrated, which I find personally annoying, once again he plays the contrarian protagonists who we have to hear his resume over and over again, the new know-it-all macho pilots, the brooding son of a deceased pilot, the angry disgruntled CO, the underachieving nerd, the over-achieving female J. I. Jane, and of course the hot babe of which our hero has had history with, and has the overly mature teenager. Several times in the film someone's life gets saved in the split second nick of time by improbable actions, that we see coming a mile away. While the film is decently paced, the dialog exchange is slow and lumbered. One thing I DID like was the enemy is faceless which gives it a mysterious element, and a profound look at our humanity and our peace in the world. But aside from that, this isn't a film I need to see twice."

The flight combat scenes are amazing and there are plenty of them which is great. You really get behind the characters during these scenes.

However, portraying american fighter jets as the underdogs when they have a larger miltary budget than the whole of europe combined is laughable. Also, they dont generally carry out operations for the good of mankind. Had they been fighting for oil or resources it would have been more believable."
simianfriday,"Jan 29, 2023",4,"This movie is overhyped garbage.
I simply cannot understand all the glowing reviews for this movie. There are maybe two or three short scenes in the entirety of the movie that are any good, the rest of it is, at best, nostalgia-bait and at worst absolute trash. Where to begin...

Let's start with the plot... who are the enemies in this movie? What are their motivations? Based on the mission briefing it seems they're enriching uranium and bringing a power plant online that apparently the navy isn't too keen on... why? What's so bad about this nebulous ""rogue state"" bringing a power plant online? None of this is ever explained, we as an audience are just left to make assumptions that this is bad for... reasons. I mean, that *could* be ok if those reasons were somehow easily inferred but they're just not and because of that the stakes feel entirely non-existent.

Speaking of the mission briefing - I can't be the only one that said ""this is literally just Star Wars and the attack on the Death Star."" I mean *COME ON!* They have to fly a treacherous path down a narrow trench, keeping a low altitude to avoid being shot down, in order to dive in and torpedo a small target before flying out? There are scenes throughout this movie that feel like they were lifted right off the Star Wars Episode 4 cutting room floor. It is absolutely absurd. I'm surprised Maverick didn't tell all the trainee pilots: ""It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.""

Furthermore, the aircraft carrier they're launched from also launches a whole bunch of tomahawk missiles at an airstrip belonging to the enemy that's a mere two miles away from the intended target. Why exactly can't these tomahawk missiles instead be used to take out the target itself? Why send 4 manned jets on a nearly impossible trench run toward the target when you don't have to? Speaking of - why does this mission need manned aircraft to begin with? I mean, the movie starts with an admiral coming to shut down the program Maverick is involved in so he can divert funds to the unmanned aircraft program he would rather be funding - a scene that ends up being entirely pointless because literally nothing about that is ever revisited or even plays a part at all in anything else that happens in the movie from that point forward.

No reason is ever given - or even hinted at - for why unmanned craft couldn't have been used for this, or why they couldn't have simply destroyed the target with the tomahawk missiles they had, instead of destroying a nearby airstrip.

So yeah... I do not care about this mission. The only reason anyone watching this movie has any reason at all to care is if, for some strange reason, they care about these characters dying. But why would we? We're not really given any reason to care about these characters because we spend no meaningful amount of time with any of them apart from Maverick himself.

So let's talk about the characters... we're introduced to about a dozen or so pilots we're told are ""the best of the best"" (told, not shown) and then we get a very basic training montage with them before a handful of them are selected to actually fly the mission. Can any of you who rated this movie an 8, 9, or 10 tell me, without looking it up first, which pilots were selected to fly the mission and which ones were not selected?

I'll even help you, here are their call-signs: Rooster, Hangman, Payback, Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Fritz, Bob, Fanboy, Tex, Omaha, Coyote, Rhino, and Halo.

I bet you can name a couple correctly, but I doubt very much you'd name more than that. But don't worry - it's not because you have a bad memory or weren't paying attention, it's just because these characters were boring and barely had any screen time. The movie gives you no real reason to care about any of them apart from Maverick and, to a *substantially* lesser degree, Rooster.

Got your answer yet? Did you notice I added 3 names (Rhino, Tex, and Oxford) that weren't even among the pilots in the movie? Did you notice I left out Phoenix? No? Yeah, that's my point. More than half of these characters should have been *entirely* cut out of the movie so we could actually give the ones that (should) matter some screen time so that the audience has a reason to care whether they survive or not.

Moving on - the entire inter-personal conflict between Maverick and Rooster is contrived nonsense that barely plays into anything at all. What's most disappointing about this is that it *COULD* have been done differently to carry much more dramatic and emotional weight - but instead of using Goose's death in the first movie as a catalyst for their personal conflict, they totally gloss over that and basically only ever use it to tap into the nostalgia the audience has for the original movie. Instead, the conflict between Maverick and Rooster is because Maverick pulled Rooster's papers. It's literally a dispute over paperwork.

I mean... sure - that could result in a serious issue and bad blood between two people. I'm not trying to dispute that - but *WHY* is this how they chose to do that when they had such fertile ground to work with in the form of Maverick's relationship and connection to the death of Rooster's father? Why on earth did they sideline that and use it only for some ""Great Balls of Fire"" nostalgia nonsense? It just makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Maverick's relationship with Penny? This doesn't even make sense. We're given some vague backstory about how he broke her heart in the past - but why then is she so quick to just welcome him back without batting an eye? All he did to get back in her good graces was show up at her bar looking handsome. Heck, if that's all it takes somebody please tell me where I can bump into Jennifer Connelly because I'll be there tomorrow.

I could go on and on about how bad this movie is but this is getting way too long as it is so I'll move into rapid fire round...

The music: again, this is really just playing to nostalgia for the most part. On some level that's fine - it's actually nice to hear the main theme again. Even ""Danger Zone"" was good to hear (although, it kind of felt like they shoehorned it into a weird spot in the movie). But it never tries to do anything new and leans far too much on nostalgia that it just comes off boring and forgettable.

The dialog: ""Talk to me Goose,"" ""Talk to me dad"" - etc. Come on. This is just silly.

The nostalgia in general: As mentioned many times already in this review the nostalgia is played up far too much in everything from the plot to the characters to the dialog to the music to the silly ball game on the beach, to Maverick ""buzzing the tower"" - etc. It's all just too much. A bit of this is to be expected but this sort of thing really needs to be kept to a wink and a nod - instead it was done with all the subtlety of a brick to the face.

Believability: Not only is it absolutely *absurd* to believe that Maverick was able to exceed Mach 10 - which is literally more than *TWO MILES PER SECOND* - but when that plane exploded from the stresses it would have absolutely disintegrated Maverick along with it - there is *ZERO* chance he could have possibly survived that flight, let alone the explosion. This is, ironically, one of the most forgivable issues with this movie though - because it's all in the first opening minutes of the movie and ultimately it amounts to *NOTHING AT ALL* for the duration of the rest of the movie. Cutting it entirely would change nothing.

Anyway, if you haven't figured it out yet, I hated this movie."
Xstal,"Sep 7, 2022",8,"A Cruise of a Missile...
It's like a modern interpretation of The Dam Busters, but with jet propelled planes and huge thrusters, an impossible road, to deliver a load, with all the courage the pilots can muster. There might be a bit of Star Wars in there too.

A cinematically impressive piece of film making that will probably act as the best piece of recruitment propaganda the navy or air force could ever have wished for. Some solid acting, Tom plays Tom as he always tends to, and the rest of the cast fill the stereotypical roles as required.

I ended up revisiting the 1980s version prior to watching this and enjoyed it more than I thought, and it certainly helped to map a lot of parallels between the two, none more so than the irritating background synthesizer."
jtindahouse,"May 24, 2022",8,"Style and substance this time around
I admit to not being the biggest fan of the original 'Top Gun'. I found it style over substance and that isn't really what I like in a film. Yet here I was on opening night for the sequel. Such is the quality and high standard that Tom Cruise is putting into every movie he is involved in these days. I wasn't let down. This film had the style, but it also had the substance.

Firstly, I thought the cast were really good. Good looking, stylish and charismatic - almost to a fault. It can come across a little arrogant and egocentric, but I think that's what you have to buy into to enjoy these films. These guys are hot-heads no doubt about it, but that's what people pay to see.

There are some very good action sequences in this film. When you're watching a car chase in a movie it is very easy to keep track of where everyone is at. In a plane chase though it is very hard to get context of everyone's situation. It can be a little confusing at times but I thought the film did a good job of keeping us in the loop (so to speak) as much as they could.

There's plenty of fan service to the original. I thought Val Kilmer's scene was handled very well. Touching, sweet, funny and as respectful as it could be. The film is also quite well paced. It's over 2 hours long but it never feels like it is dragging. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie. 8/10."
shelbythuylinh,"May 26, 2022",10,"Sequel Much Better than Original
Thirty-six years worth that of the wait. Tom Cruise returns to his star making role of Pete Maverick Mitchell that is now a Captain but he has not changed his way of doing things hint his nickname.

Those over him like Ed Harris and Jon Hamm both not agreeing on a professional level what he does but seem to albeit reluctantly have a respect for him personally.

He is reluctantly either given the choice to go back to the Top Gun school but as a teacher or face dishonorable discharge.

Slowly yet surely he has earned the respect of the other pilots. Miles Teller as Rooster Bradshaw holding a grudge against Maverick over his late father, Goose Bradshaw's death in the original as the latter was his best friend.

We see a very ill Val Kilmer in a two to three minutes as his former rival turned close friend Iceman now an admiral. It is very sad but very much worth remembering.

Jennifer Connolly instead of Kelly McGinnis as the new love interest and single mother as the one that got away, the former not so much the latter.

Maverick is more married to his job and that is why he never got married nor had kids.

Great support also from breakout star Glen Powell as a pilot named Hangman who is cocky as he and Teller's Goose have a rivalry there.

Movie is dedicated to the memory of the original director Tony Scott, who tragically died from suicide in 2012."
Joxerlives,"May 28, 2022",8,"Can't remember the last time I smiled so much in the cinema!
This was just such FUN! When I was leaving the cinema people were openly saying how good it was and I had to agree. Ok so large part of it don't make much sense, why do they have to attack with such a small force (in a scenario straight out of Star Wars), why not have the rest of the squadron perform flak suppression on the SAM sites? Lots of homages to the first film not to mention 'The Right Stuff' but had to admit was on the edge of my seat when Mav went to Mach 10. Great gag when he walks into the diner in his burnt flight suit and asks where he is only for the kid to reply ""Earth!"". I think the romance between Mav and Penny was good although I far preferred her before her reduction surgery. Shame they couldn't have got Kelly McGillis back to play Iceman's wife, would have been an nice touch. Speaking of which that was the most emotional part of the film (far more so than all the daddy stuff), seeing Cruise and Kilmer together in a situation that wasn't too far from real life, I highly recommend everyone watch the documentary 'Val' although it is rather heart-breaking. So was it cheesy? Yes, very much so. But was it 2 hours of action, 1980s nostalgia and first rate entertainment? Yes and I would highly recommend it."

ShaneC1972,"Aug 29, 2022",6,"Aerial sequences were great, but lazy plot and story could have been so much better.
Ariel sequences were great, but the lazy plot and story could have been so much better.

I think the problem is that Maverick was a 2D character, and one of those dimensions hung on being young, cheeky and good-looking. Thirty years on only the risk taking fighter pilot dimension survives and so to bring Top Gun back, they borrowed far to many themes from the first movie; Hard-ass superiors, Maverick on his last chance, best of the best, hard deck, cocky pilots, pilot rivalry, mysterious enemy. There is really nothing new here, Even for the sentimentality they lazily just relied on the Goose sub-plot line."

latinfineart,"May 29, 2022",6,"Entertaining, but no big deal
I can understand why this movie is so popular in the United States, an audience that the accustomed to Marvel, Disney World and a lot of artificiality in their lives. I consider this movie to be about a 6, it was entertaining if you didn't think about it too much.

The performances were decent but nothing really stood out, there was not a single performance that stood out, everybody did an adequate job. I must confess to never understanding why Joe Hamm is a celebrity or has the tiniest bit of fame, that's one issue I had with the film. There were a couple of characters that were pretty annoying, none of the characters were well-developed, the writing seemed pretty poor, and on the juvenile side, and Tom Cruise's performance was about on par with everyone else. Adequate, but nothing special, just adequate. I would describe this entire movie as nothing special, just adequate.

The best parts were the aerial scenes, but I don't understand why this film is considered special. It was just adequate. The direction, the score, and the performances were good enough. The two performances that stood out for me, were Miles Teller (as usual) and a brief cameo by Val Kilmer, and the cinematography and production were very good."
dreamfactory-534-814309,"Aug 24, 2022",4,"Geiser-teaser overrated nostalgia
For of all, this movie is not a sequel, it's a literal remake of Top Gun, nearly scene by scene. It went the Force Awaken route and just stole the script of its originator while adding aging actors to it.

The new characters added to Top Gun Maverick are all dull and uninteresting. The flying scenes are lame and all shot with what looks like a fisheye Gopro set above the cockpit. To ANYONE who remembers watching the original in theaters, don't try to pretend that this is somehow exciting and an awesome movie. It's long, slow, dull, lazy, marred by a terrible script... If this movie had been released 20 years ago it would have been torn to pieces. I think that the way CGI and the woke movement have destroyed filmmaking, anything that even remotely looks like a real movie is worshipped with an above 8 rating."
buckeyes-05926,"Jun 13, 2025",9,"The best legacy sequel Hollywood has to offer.
Top Gun: Maverick is a thrilling, high-octane sequel that not only honors the original but soars beyond expectations. Over three decades after the first film, Tom Cruise returns as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, now a seasoned Navy pilot called back to train the next generation of Top Gun aviators for a high-risk mission. The film blends nostalgia with modern spectacle, showcasing breathtaking aerial sequences that are as impressive as they are immersive. Cruise's commitment to practical stunts-actually flying real jets-gives the action an authenticity rarely seen in today's CGI-heavy blockbusters.

The emotional core of the story, particularly Maverick's complicated relationship with Rooster (played by Miles Teller), the son of his late friend Goose, adds weight to the adrenaline-fueled narrative. Jennifer Connelly brings charm and maturity as Maverick's love interest, and the supporting cast, including Glen Powell and Monica Barbaro, shine in their roles.

Director Joseph Kosinski balances reverence for the original with fresh energy, creating a film that stands strong on its own. The music, visuals, and pacing all contribute to a theater-worthy experience. Top Gun: Maverick is more than a sequel-it's a powerful reminder of why we go to the movies: to feel the speed, the stakes, and the spirit of adventure."
Who_remembers_Dogtanian,"Sep 9, 2023",8,"AIRPLANE III
Hilariously cheesy but thoroughly enjoyable. They've unashamedly not just included every cliche ever conceived but used them as the basis of the whole thing. Such blatant cheesiness makes this brilliant fun.

What makes this madly and stupidly great is that as the story gets even more preposterous, everyone continues takes it completely seriously. Surely you can't be serious - I am and stop calling me Shirley. It's not quite as funny as AIRPLANE but it's getting there.

Shirley, Tom and the writers intended this to be tongue in cheek, it's too good to be anything else. We're definitely laughing along with them, not at them. Nuttiness aside, it's fabulously put together and the over the top acting from all of the stereotypes, or characters as some might call them is perfect for this wonderful nonsense.

Is well known that sequels usually are not worth of the good will their predecessors carry on, but this one is a quite nice exception. You get what is expected of a movie like this, but without a doubt the plus for this one is a super entertained, emotional and immersive film. The sound is great and the air sequences are exciting in a manner you can feel the passion , the excitement the pilot is feeling in their seat. I really loved the air sequences, cannot say right now another movie to highlight in that regard. Again, air sequences are fantastic. FANTASTIC. So real, so natural view, so immersive. Sound is great and of course IMAX is recommended. I loved the cast, all of them are nice and welcomed additions. There are some very emotional scenes that worth the ticket alone. Plot, is made to enjoy. Every bit. Lovely references to prior movie and superb cinematography. Music is good, however didn't find a new classic song for my particular taste, but maybe there is one for you. Super enjoyable product, the one that put you to search where to learn to fly.

Tom Cruise did a good job portraying Maverick like the 80s egomaniac he would of been.

Flight screens were awesome and Val Kilmer's appearance was really touching."
gdoumerc1984,"Jun 5, 2022",8,"A very worthy sequel
Just enough nostalgia from the original 1986 movie, retrofitted into 2022 to make everything seem familiar. An older and somewhat wiser Maverick faces new challenges, ghosts from the past, and heroic opportunities to be himself. Best role for Cruise in quite a while, really brought some depth to the character. Very touching to see Val Kilmer reprise his role. You'd swear these two had really been friends for 35 years. And Jennifer Connely was excellent as well. Lastly, the aerials were probably the best I've ever seen. A big thumbs up."
Prismark10,"Jun 16, 2022",7,"Top Gun: Maverick
In the 1980s blockbuster movies were being redefined thanks to MTV. High octane concepts, rock songs, synth scores, colourful photography with plenty of sunsets and fast vehicles.

Top Gun in 1986 was the epitome of this type of movie which began in the early 80s with movies such as American Gigolo and Flashdance.

The aesthetics provided by producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. Director Tony Scott provided the sheen.

36 years later, the sequel arrives. Dedicated to Tony Scott who died in 2012. This is a Bruckheimer/Simpson production even though the latter died in 1996.

Joseph Kosinski who made the belated sequel to Tron is the man hired to direct this tardy follow up.

Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot on an experimental plane designed to go to Mach 10. He has been passed over for promotion many times because of his rebellious attitude.

Maverick is now regarded as a dinosaur. Under the watchful eye of old foe turned friend Iceman (Val Kilmer.) Maverick is back to Top Gun school.

He has a few weeks to prepare a group of hot shots to undertake a dangerous mission to destroy a uranium plant in a rogue country. The plant is guarded by SAM missiles, hostile mountain ranges and there has to be several miracles for the plant to be blown up.

Maverick does not feel cut out to be a trainer. Especially as one of the pupils is the son of his late friend Goose. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller) is angry at maverick over his father's death and being held back in his flying career.

Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same beats as the original but with a fresh lick of paint. It even has a knowingly homo erotic football scene on the beach.

The mission is a homage to the original Star Wars. Cruise has insisted that CGI is minimally used, the aerial photography is the tops.

This is a fun popcorn movie. There is little that is groundbreaking or new. It is an alternative to the Marvel blockbusters.

Cruise wisely references the original movie with several clips. There was genuine emotion in the cinema to see Cruise again with Val Kilmer who has been recovering from a serious real life illness."
shelleyalevin,"Feb 5, 2023",3,"Blah
I don't understand the overwhelming positive reaction to this film. The writing is so so soooooo lazy. It's like they just thought, ""we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of this part of the original, we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of that part of the original."" It's beyond predictable, reductive, and overly familiar. I get that it's a sequel but this is ridiculous. And Jennifer Connelly - who I usually like very much - is really annoying in this. I don't necessarily blame her, though, I think it's the writing and directing. A real positive though is this: Miles Tenner is perfectly cast."
richy_palmer,"May 27, 2022",8,"Good but not great
When the opening credits started up I thought we were in for something special. The music, the graphics.. wow.

However the movie ended up being a bit too centered on Maverick where it could have focused a bit more on the supporting characters like Rooster. It was also a bit too melodramatic in parts to the point of being a tad boring inbetween the action.

The music was generally great but Lady Gaga really felt out of place. Could've ended on one of the bangers from the original movie to leave a better ending impression.

The action though was intense and had a lot less CGI than current movies so that was sweet to see.

Overall still a good action movie to see at the theater but needed a bit more to be truly great."
hfreinoso,"Jun 3, 2022",10,"So glad I saw this film.
I was never anticipating Top Gun Maverick. I thought Top GUn was good, but not great. I couldn't care less about the film, but most people and my friends said it was amazing. So I went to see it. And sure enough, it was one of the best experiences I have ever had on the big screen while watching this, and holy sherbert was this a film to have and has no right to be this level of good.

Pros: Because Rarely do you get a sequel that measures well against a Blockbuster like what Top Gun was. But I have to say, and excitedly, Maverick does just that. I enjoyed the action here, great stunt flying by this highly skilled team of aviators because this action was the best action I have seen in a long time. I take it back because the action and suspense were breathtaking. Never had I wanted to beg someone to make it out of life in the most messed up and dangerous situation. The cast was great; Jon Hamm stood out to me as a big presence. Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic; the romance scenes were extremely tasteful and did not detract from this film's core 'action.' The cinematography was first-rate, and the story was solid; the acting was spot on. Jerry Bruckheimer preserved the magic, and There was enough reference material in the movie to remind or retell the original story for those who had not seen Top Gun keep everyone up to speed. Bringing back Val Kilmer was a nice touch as well. The great story they put together to work that in. But Maverick and Rooster were the show stealers of this film; their problems with each other were like a father trying to protect and reconnect with his son. A big plus is that there were more PRACTICAL EFFECTS than CGI. One thing in the modern era where everybody loves to use CGI instead of practical, this was a huge plus for me.

Cons: Nothing much, but I wish there were even more action scenes, as they were all good and entertaining.

Overall, the film was outlandish; they made me like this with some breathtaking action, and I couldn't believe I would skip this film. But I was so glad I saw it on the big screen. 10/10. Perfect."
eddie_baggins,"May 30, 2022",9,"A triumphant return to the skies
After not only a 36 year wait but a painful few years in amongst that awaiting the Covid-19 pandemic to be tolerated enough for cinemas to be back open for business as per usual, the sequel to iconic 1986 action thriller Top Gun has finally landed in the form of the much-hyped Maverick.

A follow-up that has absolutely no right being as good as it is, director Joseph Kosinski and his star Tom Cruise have blown expectations out of the water for their return to the high flying world of American pilot extraordinaire Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a talented and confident loner who is still haunted by the death of his best friend and facing a changing world where his kind of pilot is no longer considered necessary in a changing landscape where man are too be replaced by machine.

Perfectly balancing homages to the past that is sure to please die-hard fans, respecting the era in which Top Gun was birthed into, bringing in new characters to Mitchell's world and giving us a story we can invest in while gifting us the adrenaline rush a film like this should inject into our eyeballs, Maverick is a highly functional balancing act of pure entertainment, thrills and heart and while there's nothing out of the ordinary about the story being told in this venture, Kosinski and Cruise's commitment to the cause and ability to be at one with itself allows Maverick to succeed where so many similar ventures have failed in recent times.

To call Maverick one of the most successful sequels of all-time may seem far too over the top but with all things considered there's reason to be so buoyant about such a statement and the fact all involved with Maverick were up for doing things the old fashioned way when it comes to stunts and set-pieces, ensures that the spectacle found within Kosinski's fast-moving and constantly entertaining exercise is one of the best examples of Hollywood filmmaking seen in the last decade, on par with the likes of Mad Max: Fury Road and Cruise's other beloved property Mission Impossible when it comes to bang for buck and top-tier blockbuster outings.

It's extremely rare for a film of this kind to somehow give time and place to all of its components, giving them time to shine and work alongside one another but that's what happens here as the story of Mitchell's grief and desire to find peace with his life comes full circle, all the while giving us a birds eye view of being a pilot in a generation of advanced military machines, culminating in one of the most memorable finales in some time that is sure to have audience members gripping their seats and swaying their heads left and right as the exploits in the skies take hold and Kosinski and Cruise's imaginations come to a stunning conclusion.

Throughout all of this is a collection of memorable performances with Cruise once more displaying a rare ability to possess Hollywood charisma almost unlike any other peer while new additions to the Top Gun world such as Miles Teller as Goose's son Rooster (with Teller looking uncannily like his fictional father), Jennifer Connelly as Mitchell's love interest Penny and Glenn Powell as the cocky Hangman all making memorable appearances while a touching and important cameo from Iceman himself Val Kilmer will be a significantly memorable moment for many children of the 80's.

Final Say -

Old school Hollywood filmmaking makes a triumphant return in the unexpectedly thrilling (and even moving) experience that is Top Gun: Maverick. A significant achievement for its leading man and a career touchstone for director Joseph Kosinski, if there's one film you see on the big screen this year make it this one.

jcooloti,"Jun 1, 2022",10,"I can't believe I'm about to write this review.
Like so many people, I have a very hard time taking Tom Cruise seriously. I don't dislike him, but I'm not crazy about him. His movie star status is so blown out that I feel like it often makes him a target for punks like me to poke fun at him... still, his films are usually enjoyable. The last film I really liked a lot he did was probably War of the Worlds or the Last Samurai, and I'm not really into the Mission Impossible series. BUT, Top Gun: Maverick is ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. Simply put... THIS. MOVIE. ROCKS.

Where do I even begin? First I will acknowledge the most important aspect of why this sequel is so incredibly good. It's EXPERTLY paced and WELL WRITTEN. This film goes back to a formula that works so well... a formula that most modern film makers dare to revisit because they feel they aren't being original enough... or old fashioned. The simple fact is that this a feel good movie. This is something that most filmmakers dare go during such a tumultuous time in America. I often come out of action/adventure movies now nowadays feeling ashamed of being a member of the human race. I came out of Top Gun: Maverick with a sense of hope. That hasn't happened in a long time. Everyone came out of that theater with a huge grin on their face, even the ones that were acting a little ""too cool"" to admit that they enjoyed it. EVERYONE enjoyed it. It's impossible not to enjoy it... especially on the big screen.

That brings me to my next point: The big screen. Seeing this film in the theater was a good choice. The cinematography involving the very real flying sequences was really, really good. You felt like you were going 10 Gs. It's AWESOME. Simple as that. The realism of the flying is incredible. I'm so happy they didn't go with CGI and kept this real.

There is an emotional element to this sequel's story that really feels so satisfying. It's just hitting all the right notes at all the right spots. It even got me to tear up a bit. The Val Kilmer parts were so tastefully done. Really, really well done with class.

I loved the original movie, in all of it's dated cheesy 80s glory... and this sequel isn't afraid to tap a little into that but not take it too far resulting in a ""throwback"" movie. Even though it feels old fashioned and nostalgic at times, that's a great thing. That's what people want, and it didn't do it TOO much. It got it just right and also felt incredibly fresh.

I've never given a Tom Cruise movie a 10/10... not even the original. But this film deserves the 10/10. Tom Cruise's heartfelt thank you message before the film started made me chortle at first, but part of me thought ""oh dang, he must be really proud of this..."". By the time I was walking out, I see why he did that. He has truly created a fantastic, heartfelt piece of entertainment. I'd be proud too. I have a lot more respect for Tom Cruise now. I hope his films continue to deliver on this level.

Now, go see it on the big screen as soon as possible. I'm not a paid off stooge leaving a good review. I'm a cinephile stooge with good tastes that just really loved this film. Believe the hype."
heath-jeffrey,"May 14, 2023",6,"Cheesy, soap-like, with stereotypical characters
I suspect this is mostly popular for the nostalgia.

To me, from the first 5min through the next 40-ish, it was like watching some kind of remaster of an 80's movie. Same character types, music, one-liners, romance interests, etc, that movies had back then. Just with better quality film and special effects.

So, if you're into the 80's, that might be something positive about it for you. For me, it meant cliche characters, bland rock music, cheesy one-liners, and exaggerated flirting.

That just leaves the broader plot, which is pretty much soap-opera romance and pointless in-fighting, with a dash of too unbelievable to get draw in (in relation to both Maverick's skill level and characters decisions, reactions to each other, etc).

Not awful, but definitely mediocre."
stephenthompsonp,"Jun 1, 2022",10,"Worth seeing again. Great movie.
Every so often Hollywood can still make a good movie; a movie where you feel a connection with the characters and you're right there with them. One that tells a great story, has great acting, doesn't get woke preachy, and you exit smiling, wanting more, and thinking about it for hours and sometimes days. This movie is one of those. A great flick. I do think that if you did not experience the Top Gun of the 80's in the 80's, then you might not experience the nostalgia that they obviously took advantage of - in a really good way. Regardless, Cruise and the entire crew should be proud. If Hollywood made more like this we'd spend alot more time (and money) in the theaters. I enjoyed every minute of it and am planning to go again, which I rarely do."

An 80's nostalgia with best of the best winning every impossible situation by any means, anywhere...belongs to the 80's. (Commando, Rambo...). I too wish I still dreamed that there is a place in the world which everything is always A ok, but in real world such a place doesn't exist.

Action of the movie is very good though and of course avoiding the Woke stamp many companies (willingly or not) put on their movies, other than that there's nothing new here.

CthulhianPrognostications,"Jan 1, 2023",3,"???
I'm not sure what is worse... The acting, script, make up (dude, lay off the blush) or the fact that (imo) this movie is CRIMINALLY overrated. My girlfriend and I were literally shocked speechless at how stilted the acting was. And we are both fans of the original, so it has nothing to do with the subject matter.

I think the disgustingly high rating is due to the overall ""dumbing-down"" of society in general. Mediocre has become the new high mark and a public that devours TikTok, Twitter and Snap like gospel deserves nothing better I suppose. This is the drivel that captivates the audience that enables ""social media influencers"".

Tom should stick to his cult ""religion"" and, after this schlock-fest, Shia should stay in the WWII tank movie and drunk & disorderly arrest video wheelhouse.

This was by the best movie I have watched in a long time! Joseph Kosinski did a great job directing and the producers did a wonderful job making the movie come together. I feel like it is really hard to make a sequel to a movie better than the first one especially how far apart they were produced, but this movie surpassed the original. The flying scenes were amazing, there were times I felt like I was in the movie and was on the edge of my seat. The camera angle, dialogue and point of view really helped enhance the movie. As a viewer I felt like I was in this amazing action movie. Casting was done perfectly, the actors and actresses that the casting directors chose were perfect for each role."
stjopex,"Oct 9, 2022",10,"Took my breath again
Don't listen to the haters. This is a movie about fighter planes, and the dogfights they are involved in. Just good old American action superbly shot. Everything else in the story is irrelevant as we all know the story. We don't need to know which country went rouge or what 5th gen fighters they have. We don't need to know more about the characters nor do we need their development. Feeding us with nostalgia instead worked for me.

Technically, however, it's a brilliant movie, the shots, the editing, the sound, made me feel like i'm in a flight simulator, especially when Mav stole the fighter to show that the mission can be flown; i even felt dizzy from all the left-right cornering in the canyon. Pure, 100% entertainment guaranteed."

paul-allaer,"May 31, 2022",8,"Superior in every which way to the 1986 original
As ""Top Gun: Maverick"" opens, we are in the ""Mojave Dessert, California"", where Maverick, now a test pilot, is working to fix one of his planes. He is called into a meeting where he's told that Admiral Cain is planning to shut down the program, that Maverick is being transferred back to the Top Gun, this time as a teacher. Before Cain arrives, Maverick takes the hypersonic prototype on one more flight, attempting to reach speeds of 10G. At this point we are 10 min into the movie.

Couple of comments: this long-delayed sequel to the 1986 original ""Top Gun"" is directed by Joseph Kosinski (""Oblivion""). Here he reunites with Tom Cruise, and what a reunion this turns out to be. The movie's script is surprisingly well developed, and hence I was unexpectedly invested in the story and these characters. Then there are the flight scenes. Let's just say that I haven seen anything like it before. Yes, it's that good. The cast is quite good. Cruise is supported by Jennifer Connelly (perfect as the love interest, and thankfully the movie makers decided not to go with someone who is half Tom Cruise's age); Miles Teller is excellent as Rooster (the son of Goose); Jon Hamm and Ed Harris (as higher-ups in the Navy), and last but not least Val Kilmer, who plays in just one scene, but it's a touching one. Bottom line: I was simply blown away by the movie, which is the rare sequel that is superior in every which way to the original. (As an aside, Tom Cruise opened the screening with a heartfelt thank you to all viewers for coming out to the theater. It couldn't have lasted more than 15-20 seconds, but I thought it was a really nice touch. You can say and think of Cruise what you want, but you can't argue that he doesn't take his job seriously, and he'll do just about anything to promote his films and schmooze the crowds.)

After having been delayed for 2 years due to COVID, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" finally premiered in theaters nationwide, to great success both at the box office and with critics (there is good reason why this movie is currently rated 95% fresh at Rotten Tomatoes). Of course you don't have to believe the hype, so I encourage you to check it out (the bigger the movie screen, the better), and draw your own conclusion."
tfstbrice,"Sep 1, 2022",6,"Beautiful action scenes.. the rest I can live without.
The first half of the movie I could do without, the acting took me a while to get use to as a lot of it is a major cheese-fest.

If you can get past that it's worth waiting for the action as that's where the movie is at it's best and the best it is, the real stars are the pilots and planes themselves.

I liked the original but not to the extent that the references made me feel anything other than awareness. It's a good movie none the less but mainly due to the scenes in the air and Tom cruise being Tom cruise which is always a good thing.

To sum up - great action, well shot, awesome sound... Tom is great. Some of the acting can be real cheesy that's the only downside."

BA_Harrison,"Jun 13, 2022",7,"I feel the need... the need for cheeze!
Top Gun Maverick is like the original movie, only bigger in every department (well, except for Cruise, who is still short): the action scenes are jaw-dropping, adrenaline-fuelled cinema guaranteed to get the scalp tingling in excitement, while the macho posturing and romantic drama is cheeze, smothered with cheeze, with an extra layer of cheeze, topped with a sprinkling of '80s clichés. In short, it's been designed to appeal to those who worship the original, giving them more of what they love (including another gratuitous bare-chested beach scene for those who like that kind of thing).

I can't say that the first Top Gun is a particular favourite of mine: the action was fine, but everything else felt really corny to me, even in '86. Likewise, this sequel's dramatic moments - the bar scene, the love interest, the rivalry, Maverick's soul-searching - make much of the film feel like a very silly parody. I've got Hot Shots for that! Fortunately, when the film leaves the ground, things improve considerably: Maverick's opening Mach 10 flight is edge-of-the-seat stuff, the training scenes are thrilling, and the final mission is some of the best action that I have seen in a long time, ending the movie on a high, viewers leaving the theatre with a grin almost as wide as Tom's. Mission complete, I guess!"
ashishagupta,"Aug 25, 2022",5,"Underwhelming and unnecessary
There seem to be an overwhelming number of fake reviews on IMDB aimed to boost theater ticket sales. Unfortunately this highly anticipated film is a typical 5/10 action movie sequel.

The writing and screenplay make film school 101 blunders, like violating the principle of show don't tell. After one ""viewing"", a blind person could describe this movie as well as a non-blind person.

The plot development is campy and over the top, typical of cheesy action movies. The character development is forced down your throat, doesn't work.

The casting for this movie is inexplicably bad.

The number of plot holes and illogical nonsense tends to infinity.

A key point in the original movie was that Maverick is actually a very disciplined pilot who pushes it to the limit of what is required. Notwithstanding appearances, he is actually very considerate of his colleagues.

This sequel completely misses the point. Maverick is now an undisciplined showboating pilot. In a similar vein this sequel, despite appearances, is actually inconsiderate of the original film."
markonijecar,"Jun 5, 2022",10,"This one is for us, the lost generation
If you are reading this, before I write about the movie, I want to take a moment and thank @TomCruise for this masterpiece. My father would have loved it (he was a pilot, may he rest in peace).

When I was a kid, my father took me to see the first Top Gun movie. I remember I wanted to be like my dad when I grow up.

3 years ago, I promised him I will take him to see the new Top Gun movie when its out. The movie got delay, and Covid-19 took my father's life.

This week, I went to the cinemas 3 times, alone.

Every time i (re)watched it, same emotions, same pain, same love.

This is is by far the best Masterpiece Tom Cruise was ever a part of. Its a rollercoaster of emotions, too many flashbacks with just the right amount of humor and sarcasm.

Everyone says how the first movie is actually better than the second one. Not in this case, as TG:Maverick outshined its prequel and put a closure on the life of Captain (highly decorated) Pete Mitchell. Yes, he is still a captain, a highly decorated one.

The way the flight sequences were filmed is remarkable. Imagine a 60-year old Tom Cruise being crushed by actual G-forces in a jet fighter. Tom has aged a few years over the past 36, and this movie will be his legacy.

Will I watch it again in dolby and in Digital, and on Bluray? Most definitely."

Top Gun is one of the best movies I have seen because of its realistic scenes, the roles of each character, and its action sequences. In this film, the planes are real and specifically designed for each set which creates a realistic scenery for the audience. Top Gun Maverick builds on the characters from the original to create dynamic charters in the sequel. Each action scene was thought out thoroughly adding vivid details including explosions, plane shootings, and the beautiful background which tops off special effects. As I started this movie I was automatically hooked from the beginning to the end."

An exercise in style and direction over storyline. The original TOP GUN never did it for me, I was never a fan of the back-slapping, gung-ho stainless steel films that Hollywood puts out, and the storyline of this one is equally shoddy. Cruise is now a top trainer for a new dashing young crew, but of course they figure out a way to reference the Edwards character and also bring back Kilmer for a key cameo. The second half of the film is given over to combat with an unidentified enemy country leading to bombing raids and the like at the climax. The aerial scenes are beautifully filmed and probably the most realistic ever depicted on screen; I just wish they had more substance to go with them."

They were obviously aiming very low for this film. I felt my IQ drop a good 30 points just with the forced use of call sign names intro in the bar.

It's seriously below cartoon IQ level right from the cartoon start, then the unnamed rogue nation to fight against, the uncomfortable to watch dudes struggling to keep their abs tensed till the shot is done beach football play, and so on. It was so over played, like a daytime soap, every cheesy plot point, every hammy emotional moment hammered home to make sure you didn't miss a beat, even if you were really, really slow. They expected so little of their audience, and delivered to that very low mark.

Something I really dislike about the original Top Gun is that the whole movie feels kind of pointless because there is no real end goal. Top Gun Maverick has an end goal and has an objective. It's not just a bunch of dudes in school, it's a bunch of super elite pilots training for a very challenging and specific mission. Top Gun Maverick takes everything from the original and times it by 10. The movie did a great job of not overdoing ""Easter eggs"" from the original Top Gun.

mikeconnellan,"Sep 3, 2022",9,"Manual Pitch Override
What can I say. In 1986 I was 17 years old. Lean and fit. My eyes already towards the sky thinking about a career in aviation. Everything good ahead of me. Hope. Fun. Exploration. Discovery. Learning. A year later I would be studying and flying to earn my Private license.

My recollections of my youth always seem a little fuzzy and without crisp clarity but I wont forget how Top Gun (1986) left me feeling. It was a spectacle like no other I had ever seen. Everyone was young and beautiful. Cool beyond words. But those machines I fell for the machines. Since that time I have been a fighter jet nerd. Models, RC models, simulators and a career in civil aviation.

Top Gun Maverick was setting up to be a complete failure as my outlook on such similar projects had be set by other failures of this nature. Supposed grandiose sequils/prequils ended up in flops. I have seen every aviation movie there is to see and I with few as an exception I have ended up just sitting there counting Hollywood's mistakes in their portrayal of flight and the endless minutia that surrounds it. I still have the expectation that things will be accurate. Really accurate. But mostly I am disappointed. You would think that with all that money they would hire at least a private pilot to consult and tell them which way the ailerons should move when a plane banks right.

Within 5 minutes I didn't notice that my hands were clenched, and I was tensed up, a clear sign I had bought in. Not everything is perfectly correct, but Tom Cruise made sure that as much realism landed on film to lock in on the nerds like me. The number of flares before exhausted the manual pitch override lever to over G the airframe. Bullet count and difficulty in hitting a target.

Another point. They didn't need to oversell the female fighter pilot idea. They didn't need to ""She Hulk"" this woman. She was short and stout, just like you want them for high G tolerance IRL. She worked just fine in the film. A smooth seamless fit.

A wonderful movie. I can't remember when the last time I screamed at my monitor and clapped my hands ""F#%K Yeah!"" Who does that anymore?

Nice work Tom. Those of us in the know understand it was your consultation that made this movie what it is."
lovemichaeljordan,"May 26, 2022",10,"So epic it will make you shed a tear
One of the most epic blockbuster movies ever put on the big screen. If you're a fan of the predecessor, you will love this. A perfect mix of nostalgia and new. New fans will also be blown away. Whatever you think of Tom Cruise, this is impressive. It's beautiful, touching and epic.

This is what the big screen is made for. Huge, epic, and breathtaking action scenes with crazy sound design. The cinematography, the stunts, and the sound design combined make for an unforgettable experience. The seats were shaking and I shed a few tears from watching the action. It was just too awesome.

The action is unlike anything you have ever seen. The action sequences are immersive, nerve-racking, and epic. It's difficult to explain the feeling, but I never knew I was capable of feeling this way.

When Maverick's flying, the seats are shaking and the sound is booming. It looks stunning and knowing that Tom Cruise is actually in the cockpit makes it so much better. Tom Cruise's dedication is something else. He put the other actors through a pilot training course and teached them how to direct themselves in the cockpit. Whatever projects Tom Cruised has touched in recent years has turned out to be absolute gold. Entertainment does not get better than this.

Tom Cruise and Miles Teller put on a show. Phenomenal acting from both. Teller was the perfect casting for Maverick's deceased best friend's son. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is more than just breathtaking action. It's about family and legacy. Tom Cruise waited for the perfect script until he made the sequel, and it was well worth the wait. It's a beautiful story with layered and realistic characters, which will make you wonder who's shredding onions in the theater. Some moments are predictable, but that doesn't ruin anything.

Don't think, DO watch this movie in theaters. It is quite the ride. You don't want to miss the sound design, visuals, and feelings this movie makes you feel."

However it is still an enjoyable movie, but not a masterpiece."
cadillac20,"May 24, 2022",9,"An Epic Blockbuster Even Better Than The Original
Top Gun has been an 80's staple since it first released and remains a classic action film to this day. Even so, it's hard to believe they would come back to it over 30 years later. When it was first announced that this would be happening, bringing back a now nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise as character Maverick, I was highly skeptical. Shouldn't Maverick be retired by now? The trailers for the film didn't do much to sway my opinion. Then the positive reviews came in and I was still skeptical.

Having seen the film, I was completely wrong. This is easily one of the years most entertaining films yet. With the completely dependable Tom Cruise not missing a beat, easily stepping back into the shoes of Maverick, and high flying, practical action that will...ahem...take your breath away, this 36-years-later sequel surprised the hell out of me.

The film's overall structure is pretty similar to the original film, with lots of training at Top Gun followed by a tough mission. We meet the near dozen characters whose top tier pilots will be taking on the mission. The biggest difference here, put out early on in the film, are that the stakes are immediately raised. This is no longer just following the pilots as they train, leading into a military career. The nearly impossible mission these pilots are to be sent on is laid on the table right away. We know what's to come. There's also an emotional elements established outright, with Maverick still filled with guilt over the loss of his friend and ROI from the first film, Goose. This is compounded by Maverick having a soured relationship with Goose's son, Rooster, played by Miles Teller. We also get some familiar character types here, the most notable being Hangman, who is the pilot that most comes across as how Maverick was in the first film.

The film's emotional and more visceral stakes are well established and keep the film feeling like more than just another retread of the original film, but even if you don't feel a strong connection to those aspects, you'll likely still find yourself entertained. There's no shortage of action here and it's all superb. Cruise wanted this done with practical effects and it really translates into an adrenaline pumping, well shot, exciting time. The aerial action is outstanding, shot well and trumping anything we saw in the original film. It all leads up to what is arguably one of the most exciting aviation scenes ever produced for screen.

As someone who doesn't necessarily call myself a huge fan of the original film, I wasn't expecting this to be something I would like as much as I did. I figured the film would lean hard into the nostalgia and give us a little bit of action, but I should have trusted Tom more. His high standards show here and director Joseph Kosinski, who's body of work (including previous Tom Cruise collaboration Oblivion) would never suggest he would deliver something of this caliber, has certainly left a mark demonstrating his action filmmaking capability. This is a movie likely to go down as THE blockbuster of the summer, even amidst major releases like Jurassic World: Dominion, Thor, and Bullet Train. Film goers looking for an exciting, action packed good time in the theater need look no further."

Now we get to this. I have to say, I was swept up by the nostalgia. As I have aged, I am less militant and I found the story well crafted, positive and I was ver moved by Val Kilmer. I am still very against war and American Aggression. But I was taken in by this movie.

The young flyers would all know who maverick was.

The flying scenes were good and having val killer in the film despite his I'll health in reality. But the main story was a bit odd. Who was the enemy. How did they not notice a aircraft carrier off the coast. Or four fighter planes racing towards their target. And the helicopter shooting at maverick why?

Kind of hard to describe but for the first time in a while, this movie gave me that thrill ride of a theater experience that I've been so desperately craving. It's so rare to see movies like this anymore, and thank god Tom Cruise and his production team are pushing the envelope with films like these because Hollywood is in desperate need of some inspiration. The level of skill it took to achieve what they did with this movie cannot be understated.

This movie was an absolute blast. The romance was a bit corny but it gave you that 80s vibe. The thing that really caught me off guard was the level of emotion they pushed the story to. Definitely caught myself tearing up in certain scenes.

iamianiman,"Jun 19, 2022",10,"Already saw it 61 times in cinemas; 28 in IMAX! This is my most-watched movie in cinemas now!
I first saw the original Top Gun only back a few days ago, knowing that this film is a great blockbuster, I couldn't agree more. Better yet, I couldn't believe with what I saw with my own pair of eyes. A 1986 film succeeded in doing spectacular stunts and you couldn't tell if whether they had used CGI or not.

36 years later, Top Gun Maverick comes land into cinemas and oh my God, I literally had an orgasm witnessing the entire repertoire of Tom Cruise and his wingmen. They have done it again, and this time it's better and badder!

The engine kicks in with a similar reading card with 1986's Top Gun, only now they add the word 'men & women' which I feel is like a tribute for all fighter pilots in our current world. What comes next is similar to what came in the original, mirroring scenes but now with a touch of modern trends and technological advancements. From then onwards, my mind goes that this film will be a homage to the original, copying scene after scene but... I was wrong. They did mirror certain scenes but that's about it, suffice to bring back memories of the original which was exactly what I wanted.

What I like about this sequel is that it's not a film made for cash grab sake. It has a story to tell, a continuation to follow and a heart to making this an excellent film. It doesn't fall into the trap of most commercial films nowadays. The story flows like water, jumping from one plot point to another without feeling forced or doing it just for the sake of doing it. Yes, the major plot might be a bit gimmicky but the things that surround the plot that make the film feels authentic and rich with contexts.

Is it an action-packed film? Absolutely. It's not only full of actions but you'll be at the edge of your seat, full-on adrenaline rush, pumping all your juicy hormones as you witness all the practical effects done by Tom Cruise and the team. This film is much more intense than watching a horror film. You will not be comfortable seating at your seat, and that's a compliment for this movie. Remember when you saw Mission Impossible 6: Fallout? That final mission where Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill were in a helicopter showdown? Yes, if you like that & if you still remember how high the level of cortisol you experienced, Top Gun will be similar especially during the final 30 minutes. Yes, that final act that will suck your air out, making you gasp and grip your seat as hard as possible. That breathtaking moment that will make you shake your head and hands, trying to dissociate yourself with the scene but couldn't as you can't take your eyes off the screen.

To pile on the good notes, they also brought back some of the previous characters, mainly our favourites, not as a mere fan service but to also help drive the story forward, showing where they are now and what they had gone through all these times.

Tom Cruise as Maverick is both attractive and captivating. It's hard to imagine anyone playing Maverick, so kudos to the Casting Director of the original for predicting that Cruise is the only one that is able to perform all these stunts... practically. I still couldn't wrap my head around his bravery and courage especially after seeing all the stunts, even professionals might not be able to do what he does. It's beyond your expectation and understanding. Just mindblowing!

Let's not forget the amazing new members joining Maverick. They all did an awesome job and salute to all of them, bringing their respective characters to life. My favourite is definitely Hangman, played by the charismatic and charming Glen Powell. He's like a hybrid between Maverick & Iceman. I also love Phoenix who puts on a nice touch to women empowerment. Rooster, held by Miles Teller is engaging, he's the centre of the story that is important for Maverick.

Talk about Rooster, I appreciate all the relationships they put in into the script. They're a lot of chemistry sparks produced between characters; Maverick & Penny, Rooster & Maverick, Hangman & Rooster, Phoenix & Bob etc. And these sparks are strong enough insofar that we care about all these characters. It will set you on a journey of what it means to have a family and a group of friends that love you dearly.

The element of brotherhood in this is so strong, it's also the highlight of the film. I applause that because the sparks work, the brotherhood between characters in this also works wonderfully well. You might dislike some characters at the beginning, but you'll grow to love them by the end. I did hold back my tears at the end when I see all the things we want from a brotherhood, but my Gosh, I would have cried if I were watching it alone.

Top Gun Maverick respects its audience as they craft a story that gives a hint of what's to come/ending, only to realize later that you have been tricked as the story goes along. They know you're an intelligent audience and they respect you for that hence, they know you'll be able to predict its ending. So don't get shocked if your prediction took a wrong turn later on. Why? Because the script is already two steps ahead of you.

If I would highlight on what they could improve, I feel that they could have paced their story a bit better during the first 30 minutes. It takes a bit of a time for audience to fully immerse in the story, probably because of the urgent introduction they need to serve for the new characters.

The other thing is that yes, the cinematography in this is off the roof! It's extremely riveting everytime they're in the sky however, seldom they are times when the camera crop is off putting, like that one scene where they're playing volleyball, everything is perfecto from the thirst trap element 😂, One Republic's chill-vibe song to the perfect sunbathing but the scene falls short when we can't really see the ball throwing and catching up in the air as the camera crops the part where they need to be showing that, taking out the fun factor a bit.

All in all, we need to have more Hollywood summer films like this. The one that is wholesome, knows no boundaries, respect the audience's intelligence and gives out a highly entertainment value for all.

Verdict: 3 years worth the wait, Top Gun Maverick is a giant-sized blockbuster film that aims for the sky and successfully reaches to an altitude only a few could do so. Better than the original, this sequel is the real definition of high-octane, adrenaline rush & edge-of-your-seat viewing that pays tribute to the original while also respecting all the esteemed crews."
mailschorsch,"Oct 2, 2022",10,"Clear 10 out of 10
Toxic masculinity is back. In a good way. It has been far too long, that movies were allowed to show clear hero characters + an according dramaturgy. All of this worked for decades, before some post-post-structuralists decided to dismantle it. It seems like, they didn't win for gods sake. It's also amazing how the team managed to transport the vibe of the first instalment to this second iteration without making it feel dated. I just really wish, that directors and producers will pick up on this success story and apply this winning formula onto modern-day topics as well. As the movie pointed it out: You have to let go. But the basic principle of heroes actually succeeding without annoying the audience with ""the dark side of the character"" is a winning principle, that will hopefully be applied to many other topics as well - not just action movies."

The absolute BEST movie I have seen since the original. I grew up here in San Diego and lived in the era an stood on the deck of the ""Top Gun"" house and witnessed the orginal Top Gun logo at Miramar Air base growing up. The original hit home in so many ways and has been a family staple.

This film hit so damn hard in so many ways, I dont have words to describe how amazing how respectful and how hard it was to see the storyline progress over the years. This movie is like time traveling and catching up with an entire family you havent seen in 30 years and getting all the good and bad in 2 hours....lol.

Defenitly not an 8 star movie, maybe just for the Tom Cruise fanboys (pun intended).

Action packed, no doubt. But the level of acting is poor. The political correctness is painful. The characters are not build to any level. It's one long ""tribute"" to the original movie but doesn't come close. I was disappointed as I saw the 8.5 rating on IMDb before seeing the movie.

garethwdavies-97648,"Aug 27, 2022",10,"Cheesey and Predictable
And I loved it. The film manages to bring the story forward to the present day while still being a typical 80s action film. The film lends heavily on the original, with a few scenes that play out exactly as they did in the original, which helps to add some humour to proceedings.

Maverick is obviously a hero, but Tom Cruise is sensible enough to hand over the reins to the next generation.

The acting isn't exactly Shakespeare but neither was the original. It's a 2hr feel good film with some great aerial dogfights.

A poignant cameo from Iceman stops just short of being too schmaltzy .

Not much to say here really, the action and visuals are stunning, alone for that you should go and watch it in cinemas. If your really only here for a good story you should skip this one.

pc95,"Jun 18, 2022",5,"Tom Cruise's Victory-Lap on the Beaten Path
I remember watching Top Gun in the theater as a kid in the summer of 1986. It was loud, fast, frat-like, macho - fun for a 9 year old. Did it have the foundation for a sequel? - Nope. But don't mind that, Hollywood sees money to be made, and made it, it has. This ""sequel"" Maverick, hence its title, is a ridiculous and overlong victory-lap for Tom Cruise, replete with him thanking us in a pre-show message amid giggles. Wouldn't have gone myself, but was asked to go. You'll have to suspend disbelief on many levels to allow for this movie just to start with. The Jet scenes can be well shot, but ridiculous, and the story is way overlong and superficial - nothing more than a rehash of the last with less interesting characters to try to balance Cruise's ego-centrism. The video-game-ish plot is paper mache. Younger characters are extras for Cruise. 1986 was a fun time but trying to recapture a mediocre movie from 35+ years ago can't generate anything better than mediocrity, and for this reviewer its actually worse. Leave it alone. We were laughing at some of scenes - straight cheese."

My new most favorite movie. Just can't stop watching it. Stunning camera work, great cast. Mostly I was simply amazed at the very believable emotions Tom Cruze showed. Such talent! Raw, intense and touching. Miles Teller is a great actor, believable and perfectly cast. Glen Powell gives an amazing performance as Hangman. You know you should not like the character but you can tell under all the bravado he is a great guy. Monica Barbaro as Phoenix also gives a great performance. What a wonderful message for all the girls wondering if they have a chance in what is mostly a ""man's world."" She makes you believe. John Hamm. You could tell he loved portraying Admiral Simpson. A couple times I was sure he was struggling to keep from laughing because there was definitely a smile trying to escape! What expressive eyes!! And Lewis Pullman. He does such a great job as Bob. The nerd among jocks. But he pulls it off while proving that that particular nerd has balls!! Amazing job. Everybody did an amazing job! So good so very good!

Plus what music!!! If I'm not watching the movie I play the soundtrack!

Wonderful, thoroughly enjoyable."

Hard to fathom the fact a 24 year old kid in the first film turned 60 in its sequel.

The intensity and grip will override any goofs and technical flaws this may have noticeable only to experts in the field.

Movies like this are few and far in between these days. The first 15 mins keeps you at the edge of your seat. From then on, never a dull moment as the plot continues to build with very few detours if at all. The characters are all old school with no Mary Sues or Marty Stues to align with contemporary moviemaking. This movie stands only for sheer thrill bereft of space for political correctness that's now become a prerequisite for any movie."
fuelrodx,"Sep 12, 2022",10,"Absolute Killer
I've always been a fan in the fighter jet world having gone to many military airshows. Navy pilots tend to be the most aggressive in their flying that it puts a tear in my eye. This was the coolest way to do a movie of this type. The flight scenes were just great and you feel like you're right there with em. One of the pilots told Tom that he was never going to do the maneuver they did ever again. This maneuver was at 50ft and he said it was too dangerous. Knowing the speeds that these guys fly you could eat 50 ft in a split second and find yourself in the ground. They must have really been pushing it.

Miles Teller (""Rooster"") went to Tom and asked him if he was willing to do a Top Gun 3. So Miles told the media that he and Tom are discussing it. I hope they decide to do so.

The ONE THING that got me in the movie was the Cobra Maneuver. In every demo/flight show I have seen, there has been nothing like that. First they go canopy to canopy and it was quite close, but then peeled off so closely in a circular manner I just gushed! Folks that's really dangerous! But these guys are the best. They probably had about 3000 hours in the aircraft. By that time you're an expert."
Jorreviews,"Oct 1, 2022",10,"Epic blockbusters may one day come to pass, but, not today
It was impossible to see how the neat, action-packed adventure of the 1986 Top Gun could be topped, but Maverick somehow found a way! It is not afraid to entertain, entertain deeply, and entertain only.

Maverick's return to Top Gun is shaky but his resolve and trailblazing antics are enduring. This version of Maverick is quite different from the first movie, as age and experience would dictate, but he's every bit the daredevil that we saw in 1986. The cast does a great job with every delivery of complex characters. This is no doubt Maverick's movie, but Rooster steps up in a supporting role rivalling that of Goose and Ice man in the first movie. However, there isn't as much to get really invested in the other pilots.

This pays homage to the great parts of the first movie, while carving out an identity of its own. It goes beyond simple dog fighting and air battles to multi-layered challenges that draw the audience in further with each escalation. It also honors popular characters from the past and brings back the original Top Gun aesthetic and memorable music tracks. Personally, the new music did not click as well and may not have the ""staying power"" of the goldies from the first.

This movie has been all the hype this year, and very deservedly so. 9.5/10."
Buckaroonoodle,"Nov 5, 2022",7,"Maverick, super hero
With all of its faults, at least the first Top Gun has some grounded moments.

This sequel, if you can really call it that, makes Pete Mitchell into a superhero with all the perfect cliche moments.

While one can find the movie charming, as a sequel to a film about someone learning to get over themselves, this is more of a swashbuckler movie. From overly convenient plot points to the necessarily willingness to suspend disbelief. There are moments in the movie where I shouted to the screen ""that wouldn't happen."" Entertaining, yes. A billion dollar global phenomenon? How? Why?

Glad I rented it but will, more than likely, never watch it again."
Arthur_At_IMDb,"May 23, 2022",9,"Epic movie!
I wasn't very excited for this movie because I think Top Gun (1986) is a median movie. But Top Gun: Maverick is awesome! The last 40 minutes are pure cinema. Planes flying, falling, exploding in a cauldron of emotions

Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is back and now he has to teach a new class of pilots to carry out an almost impossible mission, having to face drones and prove that human factor is still essential.

The movie makes an analogy to Tom Cruise's view on traditional cinema. He promotes the idea of every movie should be watched in big screen and it can't be substituted by the streaming. And here, we can assimilate the drones with the streaming and the planes piloted by humans with the traditional cinema. I liked it.

The movie bets on the charisma and talennt of its cast. Well, it worked. The whole cast is very good, Tom Cruise, as always, doing his best.

The action scenes are very well filmed and choreographed. It's all practical effects and it increases immersion in action scenes. The sound work here is so good, and it is one of the reasons to watch this movie at the theaters. I hope Top Gun Maverick will be recognized in awards season, mainly in the technical categories.

But the movie is not perfect. Some secondary characters are not very well developed, and I think there's dramatic arcs that should have a better resolution.

Top Gun: Maverick is amazing, and I want to watch it again."
ItsJakeyy,"Jan 27, 2023",7,"A highway to a familiar tone
Top Gun: Maverick is popcorn, movie theatre goodness straight out of the box. Audiences should have no misconceptions about this movie. It is just as cheesy and goofy as the first move in the duology when it debuted in 1986. Effectively taking viewers back with the same golden scenery and light-hearted tone, Maverick also brings moments of emotional sincerity that set it apart from the original film.

Tom Cruise's Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell returns to the cockpit to lead the next generation on a heart-racing, death-defying new mission. The high-velocity dogfighting sequences are expertly execute to bring audiences into the cockpit and weave along with the pilots. The final thirty minutes, in particular, crafted a unique sense of intensity that will keep viewers thoroughly engaged and on the edge of their seats.

The emotional core of Top Gun: Maverick is rooted in the relationships between Maverick and faces, old and new. The primary of these is between Captain Mitchell and Miles Teller's Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw, son of Maverick's tragically lost wing-man, Goose. Cruise and Teller provide just enough emotional tension during breaks away from the high-flying jet action, but it knows its place in the film and never overstays its welcome. The same is true for the other quieter moments of reflection throughout the movie. None stay around too long to take away from the whole.

The secondary characters are equally as entertaining, each exemplifying previously seen traits fans of the original will find familiar. The clear standout is the dangerously smug Lt. Jake ""Hangman"" Seresin, played by Glen Powell. Powell brings to the forefront an overly confident cockiness that fills the gap previously held by Cruise's Maverick, who is now more quietly assured in his older age. Powell provides a worthwhile foil to Teller's Rooster and, in the end, will still keep fans rooting for him.

Top Gun: Maverick knows what it is and sticks to the script: beach scenes, corny dialogue, and jet-fueled action antics. Despite some minor slow character moments, it delivers thrills and schlocky goodness just as well, if not better, than the original."
edward-a-bowden,"May 29, 2022",2,"Paper thin plot and nothing to love.
Let's get this straight. Very few people are bigger fans of the original top gun than me, and I've waited decades for this sequel.

But it is truly awful, which has really upset me.

The plot is paper thin, with the mission ripped shamelessly from Star Wars.

There is no explanation about the scramjet programme that Maverick was piloting before he presumably crashed it.

There are no characters to love and no characters to hate.

There is no explanation for Penny Benjamin being the love of Maverick's life, given all we know about her previously was one 'ballistic' incident in the 80s.

There is precisely zero chemistry between Maverick and Benjamin.

There is precisely no sense of camaraderie between the 'best of the best' that Maverick has to coach for the 'suicide mission'. Nor is there any real sense of competition amongst them, unlike the original where they were vying for the top gun trophy.

The topless football game in the sea is a very poor rip off of the topless volleyball in the original.

There is no enemy. The main danger comes from surface to air missiles.

And finally, the shark is well and truly jumped when they steal a 40-year old F14 that is magically charged and fuelled, then take off from a runway they destroyed half an hour into the movie.

Seriously, I could go on but I won't.

Two stars for the aerial photography and the skill of the actually pilots, but there is nothing else to recommend here.

Perhaps this is what the original would have been without the genius script that was actually about one man's struggle with his sexuality with a few aerial battles thrown in, rather than just a movie about fighter pilots."

I've always wanted to be a fighter pilot and this film is everything I ever wanted in the Top Gun sequel and more. I genuinely think that this film is easily the best of the year and might actually be the best and most exciting blockbuster of the decade and I say that with ZERO exaggeration.

From the films intro that seems to perfectly remake the old one to a modern version, dazzling flying sequences that will leave you daw dropped for the entire scene. Moments of intense action that you can't possibly take your eyes off, cinematography that looks amazing right down to the way that technical aircraft systems have been limited and simplified to provide the audience with not to much information to not be boring but rather a solid idea of what the real thing is like.

The writing was well done, the cast was absolutely phenomenal, and the film's ability to capture this F/A-18 Super Hornets (as well as other aircraft) on these IMAX quality cameras as they dance across the sky was absolutely phenomenal as they all train in numerous air combat manoeuvring scenarios specific to a new kind of mission they must prepare to take on despite nothing like it ever being undertaken by any other group of fighter pilots.

Despite the fact this film is an absolute thrill ride, their were moments where the mood would change to a more emotional way and this made for excellent contrast in the film. When you see everything in this film, you are going to want to see it in the biggest screen that is available to you. IMAX if have that option.

The way this film was put together was absolutely without a doubt just breathtaking. I am forever grateful for the cast and crew and everyone involved as well as the US Naval Fighter Weapons School/TOPGUN who had brought the same joy from the original film and reenergised it for the modern generation. This is absolutely a film for anyone who wants to have an amazing time and if anyone is reading this review and hasn't seen it, GET OFF UP AND GO SEE IT NOW!

Everyone, I've never praised a single movie anymore in my entire life as I could talk about this one forever and believe me I will be. I really do think that even for those people who don't find themselves interested in aviation and combat sequences (the majority of the audience) will absolutely love this film and I can't wait for everyone to have an amazing time in the theatre as they gain a greater appreciation for those driven in life by aviation just like me.

I genuinely cannot think of a criticism for this movie that isn't a tiny nit-pick. Obviously, the flight sequences shot inside actual F-18s are breathtaking, and everything is just masterfully done. The plot line with Rooster, the son of Goose, pulls on the heartstrings just enough without coming off as overly sappy. Tom Cruise gives his best performance of the last decade. The music is outstanding, and the use of songs is much more in control than the first. Unlike the first movie, where the final battle comes out of nowhere, this entire movie builds up to this impossible mission, and the finale has so much tension and pay off.

I used to think he was a stiff actor, with a lot of forced performances. Born on the Fourth of July was a huge exception, though. I thought he was excellent in that. Even in Magnolia, which was praised, I felt him forcing his emotions a bit. He just wanted it so bad. Somewhere along the line his performances relaxed a bit. His intensity is still there, which is a GREAT thing for an actor to have, but that forced or stiffed quality was gone. He finally just became the cool cat movie star that he is. And now we come to this. Top Gun Maverick. The culmination of all the dues he's paid and all his past performances. This is his masterpiece performance. The quintessential Tom Cruise movie.

This was an entertaining film; the flight visuals were terrific, and were by far the highlights of the movie.

mdaniels-15775,"Dec 31, 2022",4,"Massively overated and unforgettable
I think I'll go out on a limb here and say I enjoyed the original film immensely more. Perhaps it's the nostalgia speaking or perhaps I was expecting a lot more substance from this instalment. Don't get me wrong, some of the special effects were excellent but I'm the type of filmgoer that needs real substance, an intriguing storyline, a complex narrative and twists and turns to keep me wholly interested. None of those elements exist here. The movie ticks all the conventional boxes but leaves the objective viewer strangely unsatisfied. Are audiences numbed to Hollywood action saga cliches? Perhaps. But I think the problem lies in the lack of daring and imagination that one finds in contemporary film making. The film was a box office success, undoubtedly, and for the stakeholders, that is all that matters. But if a few extra risks had been taken, and the script given a daring and risky turn or two, this could have been a true masterpiece. Alas. Not to be. This film will be forgotten soon enough."

That is often the way to kill enthusiasm for a sequel, but I think this productionprobably anticipated that happening?

Quite something to successfully make a movie that captures the original genre, while being sufficiently different, and modern at the same time, and after so many years!

It does work. So does Tom Cruise and the new cast.

More modern technology, and actor's hands on, make the flying sequences excellent if course. The storyline a little cliched with his relationships but that is also part of the continuing genre.. For me there was a little sometbing missing though and to be honest I can't quite put my finger on it!

The ONE THING that makes this movie so special, is the action, it is near perfection, truly a masterpiece, with dazzling cinematography that would have you on the edge of your seat, the sounds of the planes are amazing, it's nice to ""take a break"" from the CGI action craze.

The music is composed by Hans Zimmer, it uses the same melody almost every song, but it isn't a huge issue.

Every character is so likable, it's truly a spectacle, the Iceman cameo is heartbreaking, and tells us a lesson on how to make a GOOD cameo.

This movie is one of the perfect movies of the decade (imo), i can't recommend it enough."
pakchamp,"May 25, 2022",10,"Dare I say it? Better than the original!
To be fair, I wasn't old enough to live through the 80's which was probably one of the best decades to be alive. Through the stories I heard this movie is and will always be a legendary icon for it's time. It's perfectly understandable that not many movies had ever come close to reaching the incredible success accomplished with the original from 1986.

Fast forward 36 Years today and I finally got the chance to experience this thriller on the big screen! It had me feeling goosebumps from the sounds of the jets to the feeling of the G forces which had me pushing back on the theater's recliner chair with each take off.

I honestly had low expectations coming in and was pleasantly surprised to find this sequel an even better experience when compared to the original which I love.

Shoutout to Tom Cruise for sticking with his passion for a lifetime. His work is nothing short of legendary and a true testament to the legacy he has worked his entire life to achieve."
Vivekmaru45,"Aug 29, 2022",10,"Concerning the ""hype"" around this remake, I decided to give it a gander.
The last time I saw Top Gun, I was a kid in the 80's golden era of Hollywood. It was also my ""first"" Tom Cruise movie. Since then, I've seen a majority of his good films in an erratic order: The Firm, Cocktail, Rain Man, Days Of Thunder, A Few Good Men, Far And Away, Jerry Maguire, Interview with the Vampire, Mission Impossible, Eyes Wide Shut, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, The Last Samurai, Collateral, War Of The Worlds, Valkyrie, Oblivion, Edge Of Tomorrow, The Mummy. These are all of his movies I've seen.

Top Gun is a special movie for me because those days I played Fighter Bomber(1989) a game on the Amiga 500 system, a gift from my aunt. So dog-fighting held a special place in my heart(only in game not for real).

And the game itself was really remarkable. You could refuel in mid-air! The sound effects and targeting system were awesome.

Back to the film. It is a sequel to the original, continuing where Top Gun ended and subsequent events that follow Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell in his return to Top Gun as an instructor to teach the next generation of ace fighter-pilots for the U. S. Navy.

Val Kilmer makes a small cameo in the film. I was truly shocked to see how this handsome actor has aged. His role the Ghost And The Darkness about the true story of the Lions Of Tsavo is forever immortalized in my memory along with Michael Douglas.

The movie showcases realistic dogfights of this modern generation along with weaponry. Acting is decent and not over-the-top. The movie shines in the photography, sound effects and music departments. The editing and direction is top-notch.

All in all, I'd recommend this for people who like movies of this genre and those who play aeroplane simulation games. Fans of Tom Cruise should be satisfied to this possibly final entry and a fitting farewell to fans of the original Top Gun film.

Do I have more movies to recommend to you? Yes: Firefox 1982(superior film with special-effects ahead of its time), Flight Of The Intruder 1991, Flight Of The Black Angel 1991, Interceptor 1992. And as an afterthought my favorite childhood move: Flight Of The Navigator 1986(the golden era of movies)."

acdc_mp3,"Jun 18, 2022",10,"It was dumb, predictable, sappy, impossible and I loved every second of it.
This movie.... I tell ya, if were of any other name, actors, and music, I would have given this an easy 1 star review, but being a young man of 20 when the first one came out in 1986, it was like being in a time machine. I was right back there watching this one. The flight footage was just as fantastic and the story, well, yes, the cheesiness was right there with the first one. The over-the-top bravado of all the pilots was as cliche' as could be and yet, there I was dabbing my damn eyes at the outcome.

If you are younger and you haven't seen the first one, watch it before seeing this. It will make the ride much more enjoyable.

I am looking forward to seeing it again and in today's era of movies, that is a shocking thing for me to say."
simoncicalesko,"Aug 19, 2022",6,"Not bad, not great
I don't know man. I went into this movie with high expectations and frankly, I was disappointed.

It all felt corny and cheesy to me: the jokes, the plot, characters' arcs, soundtrack... This is a typical family film, beacuse it is so unprovocative and politically correct.

Most of the time (first 90 minutes) I was bored and cringing. But the last 30 minutes were packed with action and suspense, which was a lot more enjoyable.

It's a shame, because this movie could be great with more action and appealing story. But no, they played it very safe and made an average movie.

The first Top gun wasn't exceptional either, but was at least enjoyable to watch. It had this special energy about it and was spontaneous and fun. The second one was predictable and ""square"" as Uma Thurman once said."
DaddysLoot,"Aug 26, 2022",2,"I must have watched something else
First comment ever and motivated by the eyeroll rating of 8+ on this.

The Top Gun: Maverick I saw was incredibly predictable and horribly cringe-worthy. The piano scene, the torn relationships, the overacted looks between actors, the dialogue, even Lady Gaga's tune that was featured. All cringe.

In my opinion, boomers needed something from their past so desperately, that they held on to this and must have focused on only the great cameo by Val Kilmer, and wiped all the bad about this film from their minds.

3/10 at most.

Never mind. Now I see why it is rated so highly. The comments about being non-woke speak loud. It isn't that this is a good movie, because it really isn't. It's because the group that fills other pages with complaints about wokeness finally found a film they can use as a springboard for their message. While I don't disagree with it (House of the Dragon was the straw that broke the camel's back for me), don't fall for Top Gun Maverick being as good as the rating says."

dannylee3782,"Jun 3, 2022",9,"Talk to me goose
Possibly the best blockbuster I've seen in a while.

I honestly don't have much criticism. I think it even busted the genre limitations of a blockbuster. It doesn't leave a sour taste afterwards. There were a couple cliche moments but it does not damage the overall movie's impact.

What I loved

Right from the get go of the opening sequence, they make it clear that this is a reboot of the original with the old font and the music. They make sure to put enough homage and references and successfully remain true to the original Top Gun style, but just done better.


They set up the characters effectively and doesn't miss any loose ends from the original. I was particularly impressed how Maverick was portrayed because even after 36 years, I feel like Cruise perfectly recaptured the essence of the character. Not only was he successful in that, he added an even better element: a man's struggle to preserve his legacy. A much more sophisticated and nuanced storytelling compared to the original.


All of the aerial scenes were perfect. I loved that you can actually hear more of the dialogues and had better facial shots, which helped the audience to connect with the pilots more. In the original, it was sometimes difficult to do that partially because you couldn't tell who was who. This made the flight sequences much more enjoyable and understandable.


Not a single dull moment in this amazing reboot. Honestly, most reboots are like 50/50 but this should be heralded as one of the finest reboot efforts in history. This movie felt particularly better because while it paid enough respects to the original, it also fixed all of its problems, which I think is what you should exactly do in the reboot. So far, this movie has been doing extremely well both critically and commercially. Best deserved for everyone who worked on it."
EINERT,"Aug 23, 2022",10,"A Must See in Theatres
The movie would be a 8 or 9 at home but for sure a 10 in Theatres. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and the nostalgia from the original is a continued pervasive part of the film."
jeremeydavis,"May 31, 2022",10,"This movie is constantly on point
Top Gun: Maverick had quite a legacy to live up to and it nails it. The movie avoids the sequel trap of destroying the previous movies' character growth while allowing for a whole new story to be told. Maverick is allowed to be the star of his own movie (take notes Marvel) and shines throughout even as he has some very real struggles. His interactions with Penny are pure Maverick but also reflect the interactions of a more mature couple. The casting is all around wonderful, with memorable new pilots introduced. The female pilots in particular were handled well, being ""one of the boys"" without being sexualized or turning into Mary Sue's. Nods to the previous movie were integrated smoothly and every detail matters. Iceman was particularly moving. Rooster nails the mannerisms of his late father. The only minor complaint is that Maverick can't beat the original soundtrack, and acknowledges that by using several songs from the original."
prestindalling,"Sep 29, 2022",9,"Surprisingly Much Better Than the First One
First off, I'm glad that the training FINALLY got somewhere. They actually used it for a mission! Hooray!

I'm not saying that the original was bad per say, it just wasn't this movie.

You see, the old movie was flawed in a lot of ways, and this movie corrected it for me. Now I can say I like Top Gun now. I'm sure that if I go back and watch the original one, I would like it

The thing that this movie was missing was ""Take My Breath Away"" Everyone knows that was the best part of the original, but they only brought back danger zone. At least I think it was in the original. Whatever

Of course, since this is a Tom Cruise movie, expect all the same shenanigans that are typically in his movies, like him being a smart Alec, taking his shirt off all the time, running scenes, and Spy-Ex-Machina bull crap.

9/10."
gforce762,"Jun 27, 2022",6,"A FUN, BUT CLICHE FILLED AND TOTALLY FORGETABLE FILM
Oh where to begin. The fun of TOP GUN is there, and that is about it. The cliches start right from the beginning. Yes Maverick is going to break the rules. Yes he will be a dressing down. Yes he will bounce back to be an instructor, because he is the ""best"" that the Navy has to offer. Yes he will disobey orders and be insubordinate but get away with it because the Admiral (a shell of his former self) will cover for him. Yes he will have a fight with Rooster, conveniently, Goose's son who still blames Maverick for his father's death and holding back at the Academy. Yes he will prove that the ""impossible"" mission (sorry wrong series) can be done. Yes, he will be named Team Leader of this mission. Yes, he will choose Rooster as his wing man, etc, etc, etc. And oh by way, if the enemy has these so called ""Fifth Generation Fighters"" why would they have a museum piece like an F14 just sitting in a hanger, fully fueled and armed to the teeth? I am willing to bet that in 6 months, no one will ever remember seeing this film."
FlamingFlaming0,"Jun 5, 2022",8,"A breath of fresh air
After entering the new era of blockbuster/action movies where most scenes are filmed inside a green screen room, top gun not only reprised its role surpassing the original movie but also providing a breath of fresh air. I could almost feel the plane scenes in the cinema, the skill of Tom cruise perfecting his craft as a stuntman enhanced the experience providing a sense of realism behind the screen."
abcprivateemail,"Apr 23, 2023",6,"As formulaic as it gets.
I'll say the positive thing first, lest you misunderstand my better-than-5 rating: in terms of reboots, this one does its job adequately well. In a sea of reboot flops that I've given way worse ratings to (movies like any Star Wars film after the original trilogy, and the Matrix reboots, or tv shows like CSI Vegas, or Star Trek Picard) this one isn't a complete waste of time. It tells a decent story despite a dearth of dialog, is visually beautiful, and is paced nicely.

Now the tough love: this movie is as formulaic as it gets. Interestingly, one of the main themes of the movie is that a pilot needs to be less conservative in order to do great things, yet the makers of this movie took essentially no risks. Instead of new, bold concepts, they recycle old ones over and over. Cast with a bunch of square-jawed, buff actors, and possibly written via Blockbuster Mad Libs. Tons of references to the 1980s original, good at times, but seemed overdone. Even more self-referential in-movie callbacks, including cheesy one-liners, to the point of eye rolls that nearly detached my retinas. A simplistic, black and white world where one rogue cowboy with a heart of gold, who women can't help but fall in love with, defies orders from rigid superiors to save the day... You can practically hear Lethal Weapon dialog every time a commanding officer chews Maverick out for breaking the rules while being the best. Ed Harris gives a speech that sounded stolen from Agent Smith in The Matrix. The mission is recycled from the Star Wars Death Star fatal vent shaft flaw... I'm surprised Maverick didn't make reference to bullseye'ing womp rats in his T-16 back home.

It feels like a script written in the 1980s, with a mysterious, faceless, generic enemy, that was mothballed until 2022... Which is both a good and bad thing simultaneously. It does accentuate the nostalgia of rebooting an old franchise, one of the main reasons to even give the movie a try, so sure to please the older crowd."
paulashton-696-703446,"Aug 27, 2022",3,"Cheesy. Disappointing.
How this got 8.5 out of 10 is beyond me. The script is hilarious, and not in a good way. The story line doesn't make sense, with obvious references to the original film but without context, especially in the first half hour. And it was just for the sake of it. Like the last 30 years never happened. The number of times we laughed out loud at the terrible script made it vaguely bearable. Pretty sure it didn't plan of being a comedy, but it's the only reason we made it to the end.

A really disappointing ""shouldn't have been made"" sequel. Not following the rave, nostalgia blinkered reviews. An awful movie in its own right."

johnathanbdavila,"Sep 7, 2022",10,"Its a top notch treat for the eyes
I have watched Top Gun then watched this sequel back to back and I can say only one word about this: WOW!! The feeling while watching the Jet plane parts are truly original and amazing. It can reveal how well all those actors acted. Their did so so original. All those sequences are nail bitting stuff. And those who watched this beauty in IMAX, they felt heavenly I can say that. The direction of Joseph Kosinski is just outstanding.

I seriously cannot find fault with this movie. Every element was well thought out, down to the music, the camera panning, the scene transitions, the lengths of the scenes, every word in the script, and the incredible footage of the birds (aka aircraft) from the air.

If I had a chance to say one sentence to Tom Cruise, I would say this: ""Maverick is the most phenomenal film I've ever seen; thank you for making it the most unforgettable, moving, and thrilling motion picture ever to set foot in movie theaters."""

I grew up on the original. That was my time and I loved it. The film was amazing. And still is.

The sequel is good, but a little 'safe' for my liking. It didn't dare to try anything new. It just gave a lot of fan service and copy & paste story telling. Nothing will surprise you here.

There are a few characters in the film but very few get used. The female love interest was pointless. She was so under used. Same for a majority of the pilots.

The scene with Iceman was spot on. Emotional and well played. But the outcome was painfully obvious and a wasted opportunity.

The action scenes were okay. But in this age I expect, demand, the pushing of the envelope. I didn't feel anything ground breaking here.

The post attack story was laughable. Very dumb. They wanted something to happen so got drunk and just wrote it in. You really had to suspend reality to watch it. But the action to escape made up for it a little.

The ending was non eventful. Dull. No surprises. Flat.

Overall it was entertaining. No stand out scenes. No memorable new music. No new movie quotes. Just a routine action film.

It may grow on me. But for now, it was just okay..."
thebricks,"May 30, 2022",4,"Low effort cash grab sequel with a ton of plot holes
1. Still acts like San Diego is the same place it was in the eighties, which couldn't be further from the truth.

2. Maverick is, career-wise and socially still in the same place he was in 1986, which is hard to believe.

3. Despite having pictures all over Pacific Fleet's lobby and being a legend in Naval Aviation, today's young top aviators have no clue who Maverick is.

4. Unnamed enemy nation has fifth-generation fighter jets but no nuclear weapons, which is simply impossible.

5. SAM missiles are easily visible on mountains but while cruise missiles were sent to take the airfield out, none were sent to take out the SAMs, which would have made the mission a lot easier.

6. Tiresome trope at the beginning where Tom Cruise crashes the experimental plane, ends up in a diner around the Southwest that looks like it time traveled from the seventies or eighties, from the restaurant to the clothes people wore. I traveled all around that area and no one dresses like that. They all dress like Americans do all over the country. Waitresses at diners also all wear polos and pants, they don't wear dresses from the eighties. Hollywood seems to still think flyover country hasn't changed since 40 years ago.

7. Pretty sure fifth-generation fighters wouldn't have to engage in a dogfight at close range with an F/A-18.

8. Perhaps the most ludicrous scene in the film, the Hind attack helicopter is searching for Maverick and chooses to fire at him instead of capturing him. That doesn't happen, not even in Ukraine. Pilots are valuable to use as bargaining chips. Even regular soldiers are as we've seen in the past couple decades. You would think an advisor would have told them that scene was dumb.

9. Other than a brief mention at the beginning, the movie pretends drones don't exist, which is a missed opportunity. Along with the Ukraine War, it makes the film look dated.

10. Too much nostalgia for the old film, from the soundtrack that was copy and pasted with no variation, the need to include Goose's son, which was unnecessary, including Ice as a Commander. Cruise also doesn't show his age. The film needed to go in its own direction, not act like it was set one year after the original Top Gun.

11. The training for the bombing run wasn't realistic. They couldn't copy the canyon exactly. Much of what Maverick did is likely already being taught to top aviators or easily accomplished by tech. If you know a lot about military equipment, or more than your casual viewer, the film is kind of silly.

Top Gun was alright, but a sequel just wasn't warranted and was guaranteed to be off. It's a decent watch once, but look for this to be quickly forgotten like that Independence Day sequel. The high praise and reviews are kind of unwarranted."

g-unit1111,"May 31, 2022",9,"Note to Hollywood: This is how a sequel is supposed to be done!
This movie is why you go to the theaters. And in 2022, after two years of not having this kind of excitement, it rejuvenates the movie-going experience and shows why we love movies in the first place. As someone who was obsessed with the original movie when I was a kid, I have to say they remained truthful to the original while bringing new elements and technological advancements into the mix.

Top Gun: Maverick does an amazing job of being a continuation and celebration of everything we enjoyed about the first movie and then some. Yes, there is quite a bit of fan service at the beginning of the movie, but that goes away pretty quickly and we're introduced to the new characters and the plot of the new movie as soon as that stops.

The only reason why I'm not ranking this a perfect 10 / 10 is because if you're familiar with the Youtube channel Cinemasins, there's a lot of ""He survives this"" and ""this works"" types of moments. You will notice these things pretty quickly. But they don't really detract from the main plot too much or don't seem that overly out of place for what the characters are going through in relation to the story.

(Watching Top Gun: Maverick in Hong Kong)

During the epidemic in Hong Kong, the cinemas were not fully opened. Individuals rarely enter the venue, one epidemic is still there, and secondly, there are not many blockbusters.

However, in middle age, although I have not achieved my ambitions, still love high-quality blockbusters.

1. I watched the movie three times, two of which I took my son to watch (IMAX and MX4D) together. Before entering the show, I was afraid that the child was still young and did not understand the history of the original drama. Because the focus is on the air battle scene, and the characters have little dialogue, lucky that my son also love it.

2. The protagonist's halo made himself survive many hardships, including crashing the aircraft twice and violating military orders, but the audience continued to appreciate it.

3. The literary drama and the fighting scene are equally divided, but there is no toilet time, because the character dialogue is short, concise and refined (including the opening sentence of the child~~earth), even the supporting role is very stealthy (Fat Hondo).

4. There is actually no heroine in this film (if there is, it must be F18), but they can do a lot of words, explain clearly, and have a clear character. Among them, the heroines Phoneix and Penny's daughter are especially obvious.

5. It is recommended to go to MX4D or IMAX, because the air battle scene is real, giving the audience a feeling of being there: the former is constantly changing the seat angle to simulate the fighter seat, and the latter is wide-angle and wide-angle display beyond the normal screen.

6. There are many supporting roles, but the characters are vivid and real: Ice, Rooster, Cyclone, Warlock, Hangman have all played their roles, you will always remember that Ice emphasizes friendship, Cyclone is dehumanized, only chasing the target, and every sentence of Warlock is the key point, can't find a nonsense wording...

7. The F14 at the end of the film is believed to be a lot of people who will shout when they see it. It is not the memory of the previous episode in the film. Most of them are not able to land on the aircraft carrier when they are playing games, or their mom will turn off the video games when they play halfway...

8. If you are not a parent, elder brother or senior, you may not understand why the protagonist often asks his subordinates to come back safe. People die in the war. However, if you have a teammate or a not-so-bad boss, or you are favored by others, you would rather minimize damage, because you don't want to lose a friend.

9. Don't want to spoil the show, friends who haven't entered the theater may ask themselves, if 36 years later, would there be another movie like this?"

THE EXHAUST SHAFT FOR THE UNDERGROUND URANIUM PLANT (THATS BUILT INSIDE A STEEP CRATER) JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE ANGLED PERFECTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRENCH SO A JET CAN FIRE A MISSLE INTO IT!

OMG HAHAHA PARODY 'HOT SHOTS' LEVEL WRITING GUYS!!

Seriously face-palm inducing cheese in the script and dialogue.

They kept cutting to the 'go pro' camera angles inside the jets to sell the whole 'this was filmed for real!'. Was jarring and pulled you out of the story.

ONLY POSITIVE POINTS: 1. Great (meaningless but very cool) cinematic jet fighter action if you're in the mood for it.

2. Tom (the Legend) Cruise is in it."

This movie delivered on everything you want in a movie. It didn't try to be the original, but homaged it perfectly. It never dwelled. Never tried to be more than it was, and in doing so it surpassed what I was allowed to ask for in a movie! Can't wait too see it again!"
akashnayyar,"May 30, 2022",9,"Best movie in recent years.
Although the original is incomparable, this is a good movie but more CGI then original and those lights in helmet, Only gen-x will be able to appreciate, The storyline could've been better if relationships were carried forward from the original. Top Gun anthem and those aviators on pilots are awesome. Tom Cruise was damn good at 25 and he is damn good at 60. Best movie of recent years. The screenplay always sticks to the storyline. Very good footage of naval aircraft."

joycempace,"Jul 15, 2023",10,"Better than the 1st one
As a teen in the 80s I have fond memories of seeing Top Gun in theaters with my older brother at least twice. This one is better. Maverick is now old and as a test pilot he rebelliosly pushes against budget restraints while risking the entire team's futures as he personally struggles with possible obscurity after having continuously avoiding promotion due to ""Maverick-like"" behavior. Iceman, played with heart by the beloved Val Kilmer saves his career once again by having him called back to an instructor role to train an elite force of pilots to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant against impossible odds.

He is forced to interact with the late Goose's son Rooster, played expertly by Miles Teller, whose career he thwarted. The flying is beyond amazing. The cinematography is excellent and the direction superb. Yet the best element of the film is the depth and growth of the characters. Adding Jennifer Connelly as the famed General's daughter Penny, along with Lyliana Wray as her daughter provides terrific humor and a bedrock of sensibility to counter Maverick's boundary pushing. The no nonsense admirals (Charles Parnell and Jon Hamm) oversee the high stakes task that forces Maverick to basically teach himself out of a job. As he struggles to confront loss in his past he superbly outwitts the young pilots earning their respect as he teaches them both how to overcome and survive the overwhelming odds. Overall great action movie supported with outstanding acting and filled with heart and inspiration."

setlegend,"Jun 18, 2022",7,"Beautifully done but...
I thought the intro to the movie was EXACTLY what was missing in the former. You really get to appreciate the relationship of pilots and their planes and really just the overall beauty and power of the navy. With that being said, the overall movie was excellent. Point blank period. However, cinematically, I had a few personal judgements. SPOILERS: The scene where Maverick saves Rooster from getting shot down. I loved every second of it, but that's the problem. It was just a second. I felt that moment especially should've been more monumental. Maverick sacrifices himself for his former copilot's son. Continuing on, I just felt the choice on some aspects of lighting were just off, the use of split lighting was overused and even misused. Instead of dramatic it just felt less personal. Moments where actors are crying, I can barely see them. At the end of the day I would absolutely watch it again, but I do question how some of the shots were taken. Incredible action scenes though."
zvywdzy,"May 31, 2022",10,"Surprised and Rewarded for going to see it.
Quickly immersed, tense throughout and highly emotional. Hit every thing I had wished for.

There were moments that no popcorn could be heard chewing throughout the theatre."
NatKaminska,"Nov 10, 2022",7,"Great action movie for sure, talented cast but not a masterpiece.
It's a great action movie-no doubt about that-but a masterpiece it is not, sorry. It's a mixed bag, and I gave it a solid 7, so bear with me.

First, the things I didn't like: this movie is incredibly predictable. I knew step by step what was going to happen next. I knew Hangman would save the day in the end-he's essentially the younger version of Maverick. And of course, they repeated the exact same finale as in the original. We had Rooster vs. Hangman just like we had Maverick vs. Iceman in the first film. There were obvious sentimental callbacks to the Maverick-Goose relationship, which naturally carried over into Maverick's dynamic with Rooster. If you have half a brain, you knew they would eventually reconcile and bond. They were never going to die, and anyone familiar with typical big-hero American movies saw that coming a mile away. People who claim they were shocked by the ending-well, let's put it gently-they're not exactly the sharpest tools in the shed.

Also, I found it pretty weak that we never even learn who the enemy is. In a movie where the mission is the central focus, how do you not explain who the powerful adversary is? It's like making a war movie and never saying who the other side is. That's not mysterious-it's lazy and ridiculous. So again, from a genre perspective, yes, it's a great action movie. But that's all. A masterpiece? No. You want a masterpiece? The Godfather. Or The Thin Red Line by Malick.

That said, Top Gun: Maverick does get a lot of things right. The cast is definitely talented and incredibly charming. Miles Teller is a perfect choice for Goose's son-his talent really shines. The rest of the young cast is strong as well. Glen Powell might be the most charismatic of them all-he has that million-dollar smile and great screen presence. I have to admit, I enjoyed his portrayal of Hangman the most. His character arc was obvious and lacked subtlety, but Glen is such a natural scene-stealer that it's hard not to enjoy him.

Top Gun: Maverick is simply very entertaining, and sometimes we need just that. Not every movie has to be dark and depressing. This is a big, popcorn-fueled, classic Americana film-very well made, much like Ford v Ferrari in 2019. The two have a lot in common: both are quintessentially American, father-son-type stories, celebrating technological and engineering achievements that pushed human limits and improved our lives. One focuses on aviation, the other on automobiles. Neither relies on CGI-they both use practical effects and real-world filming with help from industry insiders.

So, all in all, Top Gun: Maverick isn't groundbreaking, and the plot could have been more original and less predictable. But if you're looking to unwind, enjoy a big-screen experience, and have some good old-fashioned fun, this film is for you. It's comfort food for the soul-and definitely the action movie of 2022."
jga999,"Jan 15, 2023",3,"Predictable pulp with plotholes
There is something something with uranium that needs to be blown up. No details. Tom Cruise comes to the rescue. He is better than the best young trainees 2 generations younger. Het gets the girl, and is hired to save the mission. The girl on the runway in her porsche, Tom with his motorbike and sunglasses driving through the desert with the wind through his hair. Cliche cliche cliche. 80's revival.

Time for action. Nice visuals but you know what will happen.

What a thin cheesy plotline and so predictable."
PalomideDino,"Sep 11, 2022",10,"Worth something a lot more than the hype
It's difficult to summarize a sequel to a film that's had mass following for several decades.

It's one thing when it's simply a sequel that fits in - one where we can all say ""well, it's about damn time"" - and another thing entirely when, well, no one was expecting it.

The thing with this film is that when it was announced, no one really spurred it on nor really advocated for it - despite it looking so good - but that's exactly the point: in that context, a film would need to be quite something to perform well, and that's exactly what Top Gun Maverick does.

Such a visually stunning film without forcing any agenda nor a forced emotional connection: it simply creates itself as it's own sort of film with the right kind of nostalgia, making it... worth something a lot more than the hype."

I was, and still am, a big fan of the original and when I heard this was coming out, I didn't think it could surpass the original. It did.

It has enough to stand on its own as a film for today's audiences but enough nostalgia to take you back to the 80's watching the original.

Dramatic in the typical way of this type of any action movie (e.g. Every conversation sounds scripted & not realistic). The immersive experience that a movie theatre offers make it very much worth it-visually impressive and the music/sound make it a fun sensory experience.

Shaggers,"Jun 20, 2022",6,"Same movie, different story
This movies main quality is it's very fun. Critically it's not great. I see in alot of these reviews it's like a burger from fast food, and I absolutely agree with that metaphor. But really it only has that fun, feel good bits at the end. The rest of the story is very eh, some good parts. I feel they didn't do the relationship between rooster and maverick well, I think by the end it should be all good but in between it should've been more focused on them. But In the actual story it doesn't focus on that much at all. Also the actor for Peggy looks nothing like she did in the original which is very off-putting. And casting choice in this movie is a problem in general, it has heavy amounts of a list syndrome. I liked jon hamm in this movie, but he didn't play the part he was supposed to well, and I don't think he's a good pick. Neither with all the graduates, they all were fine, especially in action. But I didn't believe they were navy pilots. And the camerawork in this film is hit or miss, parts it's awful, way too many close ups, and not even good ones. But at times it was really creative, sometimes good. The flying shots really show this, they work very well. And that's really the main part of this film, the best part. They're very fun and engaging. Maverick isn't as weird as he was in the original, it's clear he's grown up, but he's still a bit weird and I don't feel his relationship has any chemistry still. Though I felt she was an actual human more then the first movie, she still totally switches up though. The only other part I'd say was good besides the flying portions, specifically the end is the planning of the mission, and the build up there which was done pretty decent. The music in this movie was done far better then the original, and actually usually fits the mood of the scene. Alot of the sets for this movie feel so cheap, like alot of things about this movie Do. They just feel so lifeless and even fake sometimes. Over all though, I think this movie was well done over the original, but It leans too much into the 80s style and references. Which I feel is kinda cliche and boring with some of them. As well reusing the same 80s music and even the shots feels like with alot of this they're just nostalgia baiting. Who took that picture of mav and Iceman anyway? That's never explained but it's just everywhere. Also it feels like mav didn't grow too much, still reckless and almost gets people killed. How they explained the last 30 years is good though, I think that was decently done, not making it too obvious but not hiding it. I do struggle to care about mav though, his acting is worse in this then the original. And stuff just happens, randomly out of nowhere at times. This movie also feels like navy propaganda, I don't know if they were funded by them but it feels like it, as well not only that but just feels very American, stereotypically much.

Over all score for me though is a 6.7 Very fun, not critical, but does flying parts well with a decently engaging mission plot. Even if most the characters aren't well done."
Turfseer,"Mar 29, 2023",3,"A ""comic book"" on film minus a decent overarching adversary as Tom Cruise checks in with a by-the-numbers performance
Successful war movies (whether they're fictional or based on fact) always have a worthy antagonist. In Star Wars it was the ""Galactic Empire""; in countless films about World War II, it was either the Nazis or the Japanese.

Here in Top Gun: Maverick, all Tom Cruise and his crew can muster as their grand opponent is some unnamed ""rouge country"" which operates an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant somewhere presumably in the Pacific Ocean.

We never see one face of the enemy and no real country is ever mentioned. Cruise knew that the story line had to be dumbed down because the more controversy involving a real-life antagonist spelled less good returns at the box office.

Instead of the ""big picture"" conflict between the US and an interesting adversary, the conflicts were focused on the military men themselves. Cruise as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell reprises his role as a US Navy Captain test pilot from the original 1986 Top Gun film.

Pete's flaw is that he always has trouble with authority and likes to do things his own way. This is why he's remained at the rank of Captain throughout his long career.

Pete invariably butts head with two of his commanders at the beginning and midpoint of the story. Note how similar these commanders are-both of whom insist on ""playing by the book.""

First there is Rear Admiral Chester ""Hammer"" Cain (Ed Harris) who wants to scrap the ""Darkstar"" Scramjet program in favor of drones. Pete keeps the program going by flying the program's supersonic jet at the high speed of ""Mach 10"" but crashes after pushing over the craft's speed limit.

Pete's career is saved by his mentor, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky who suffers from throat cancer (played by real-life cancer victim Val Kilmer). Iceman transfers Pete to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island in San Diego where he's tasked with selecting the best pilots for the mission to take out the uranium enrichment plant.

It's déjà vu all over again when another by-the-book commander, Vice Admiral Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson (Joe Hamm) --echoing ""Hammer""-relieves Pete of his duties after another one of the planes goes down during training exercises.

And like before, Pete demonstrates that the mission can be accomplished by proving he has the skills to get the job done. Cyclone reluctantly agrees to let Pete pilot one of the jets during the mission which was not the original plan to keep him as an instructor.

In addition to these cliched conflicts, Pete also is paired off against Lieutenant Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller). Rooster hates Pete as he holds him responsible for his father's death, Pete's former supervisor and good friend Goose. It doesn't matter to Rooster that Pete was exonerated for the death of his father as it was deemed a combat death.

What's more Pete, at the behest of Rooster's mom, turned down his Naval Academy application, delaying his career for four years. Pete also believed Rooster wasn't ready for training.

You can predict what happens between Pete and Rooster-during the mission taking out the uranium enrichment plant, Rooster saves Pete after he's forced to eject from his plane. The two improbably commandeer an old jet from the enemy's hangar and withstand a dogfight, saved at the last minute by cocky cadet Hangman (Glen Powell).

The battle sequences are divided into two parts. The first one is a training simulation and is often difficult figuring out what's going on.

The second is the mission itself, a rehash of the famous ""canyon"" sequences in Star Wars (1977)-except here jets are used instead of spacecraft.

Of course, if you like all the computer-generated battles, you will like this film.

Tom Cruise checks in with a by-the-numbers performance and soon will be too old for all this derring-do. Jennifer Connelly has the thankless role as Penny, Pete's rekindled love interest.

Top Gun: Maverick is nothing more than a comic book on film enhanced by some occasional good special effects."

A good sequel doesn't tarnish the original and makes you happy you watched it. An amazing sequel outdoes the original and makes the original even better! Top Gun: Maverick does just that. For those of us raised on Top Gun, this new installment feels like home. I found myself teary-eyed from the opening titles with the anthem, and many times throughout the movie. With its real flight scenes, amazing cast, and familiar but re-energized script, this is the blockbuster we've all been waiting for. I have never been one to clap in a movie theater, but if any movie will make you want to clap and cheer, it's this one. Tom Cruise easily became Maverick again, and Miles Teller was the perfect choice for Rooster.

chiragrathod09,"Jul 21, 2024",9,"""A High-Altitude Triumph in Storytelling and Spectacle""
""Top Gun: Maverick"" soars beyond the clouds, delivering an electrifying cinematic experience that pays homage to its predecessor while carving its own exhilarating path. This sequel embraces the spirit of the original while infusing it with modern sensibilities and emotional depth, creating a film that resonates with both nostalgic fans and new audiences alike.

From the very first scene, the film captures the thrill of flight with breathtaking aerial sequences that are both visually stunning and heart-pounding. The meticulous attention to detail in the flight choreography showcases not only the technical prowess of the filmmakers but also the dedication of the cast, particularly Tom Cruise, who reprises his iconic role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. His portrayal is layered with vulnerability and wisdom, providing a compelling juxtaposition to the reckless bravado of his youth.

The supporting cast, including Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, and Jon Hamm, adds further richness to the narrative, each character bringing their own stakes and personal journeys to the table. The themes of mentorship, sacrifice, and the passage of time are explored deeply, making the film not just a high-speed thrill ride, but a heartfelt drama about legacy and growth.

Hans Zimmer's score, combined with the classic tracks that fans will recognize, elevates each moment, enhancing the emotional beats and heightening the tension during the breathtaking dogfights. This is a film that doesn't shy away from the consequences of a life lived on the edge, creating a perfect balance between adrenaline-fueled action and poignant storytelling.

""Top Gun: Maverick"" isn't just a sequel; it's a masterclass in how to honor a beloved franchise while innovating for a new generation. With its pulse-pounding action, heartfelt story, and stunning visuals, it cements itself as a landmark film in the realm of action cinema. Whether you're a lifelong fan or a newcomer, this film is an unmissable journey that will leave you breathless, reminding you why we go to the movies in the first place."

SnoopyStyle,"Aug 23, 2022",7,"This is Tom Cruise
Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is still flying as a Navy pilot. He has avoided promotions deliberately or through insubordination. After the latest incident, he's brought back to Top Gun to prepare the best flyers for a dangerous mission. Iceman (Val Kilmer) is now an admiral and pulled the strings to bring him on board. One of the flyers happens to be Gooses' son, Lt. Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller). Maverick reconnects with old flame Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). Adm. Beau 'Cyclone' Simpson (Jon Hamm) is in charge and has no respect for Maverick.

This is Tom Cruise, for good and for ill. Sure it's a sequel full of sequel goodness with respect to Goose and Iceman. More than anything, this is Tom Cruise. It's his personality. It's his cinematic persona. He's teaching the young ones on action movies and no matter what, he is still better than anybody there. This is Tom Cruise doing Tom Cruise. I really had fun with it initially but it got a little thin towards the end. I thought he may push it over the top by doing the ultimate sacrifice to close out the franchise. It would be the edgier choice but probably not the right business choice for Tom. He knows how to work a franchise. In this modern business environment, one doesn't throw away a franchise like this. As for the other actors, I would switch out Jon Hamm with a lesser known actor. Miles Teller is very good although I have another suggestion, Meg Ryan's real life acting son Jack Quaid. Jennifer Connelly looks hot and is relatively age appropriate. She's as good as any of his other romantic partners other than his real life partner. Iceman's deterioration is a little shocking but Val Kilmer has been that way for some time now. All in all, this franchise may have regained some fresh legs."

GoatOfNeptune,"Dec 30, 2022",2,"Perfect Propaganda
This is a nearly flawless propaganda movie that fits in the 2020s. Its a clean advertisement for lockheed martin and the military aircraft industry. Comparing it to the first Top Gun, there are some differences: The military is now woke and not only consists of white men, but also of other ethnies and women, though they are only allowed in the second row. The sexualised relationship in the first movie is toned down and replaced with family values and also hints of homo erotism between the male characters. The enemys are never shown as in the first movie, you never see their faces, its just briefly mentioned, that this is a nato operation against a nuclear plant - you could also argue that this is an aggressive act of war, not covered by the UN. But politics are not discussed, the military is just a tool - and the heros just work for the hegemonic position of the usa and dont bother committing a war crime. But as the soldiers the viewers are not allowed to think about it, because if you think, you are dead. Thats the main message of the movie."

The thing that I really enjoyed about Maverick is that it took what made the first Top Gun so likeable and just built on that. All the new characters are fun and the story line is so simple but it works great.

I wasn't a huge fan of the opening scene where Tom Cruise hits mach 10, but the rest of the movie was super enjoyable. My favorite scene had to be where Maverick proves that their sequence can be done and does it in 2:15 cementing his pilot dominance.

The final mission was a great mix of intense and satisfying when you see all the moving parts coming together that we saw during the training montages and scenes. I especially liked the Rooster and Maverick dynamic there at the end of the movie.

No politics or unnecessary messages. Just a simple story with awesome shots of F18's and a cool mission.

Really my only gripe was the first scene, it wasn't horrible or anything. It just felt a little out of place maybe?

If you are looking for a movie to bring back some memories (if you remember the original) and blow you away, this is the movie for you!! Tom Cruise does not disappoint, neither does the supporting cast.

From what I have read and heard there was substantial commitment from the actors and the Navy involved in the film. Some of the piloting is just nearly unbelievable. I am going to see it a second time soon. Breaking sales records and closing in on a billion dollars already.

I do like that the enemy the U. S. faces is un named and doesn't fuel any current conflicts. Really does set up the next generation of pilots to take over the job if Mr. Cruise decides to step away. A touching nod to Val Kilmer's character lends to the turmoil Maverick faces as an aging pilot.

Worth the price of admission and going to be one that hits top marks for summer blockbusters."

No spoilers here. I can't remember what it was actually about. I was baffled, bored and broken after an hour. Acting wooden, cgi unrealistic , script formulaic and lacking any originality, casting wrong. Even Tom looks tarnished and nobody else had any charisma. Penny was ok but had seriously massive and weird eyebrows.

Wasn't' sure if it was a public relations film for the military or a naff Navy advert. Ok I was only watching it at home on a medium screen and able to make a cup of tea but I shouldn't have to endure a big screen, rumbling jets, simmering loud Zimmer, or thundering surround sound to enjoy a movie.

HeroOfTomorrow,"Jan 2, 2023",4,"Amazing aerial acrobatics... and nothing else
I'm late to the party. I know. But with all the praise Top Gun: Maverick got, we thought this would be a great popcorn flick to satiate our January-first couch potato needs.

Were we ever mistaken! I don't know what type of reality distortion field the reviewers of this movie currently reside in, but I'm not even sure we watched the same film.

The good: every single aerial scene had us on the edge of our seat. Amazing cinematography, flight choreography, and it felt like we were there. No idea how they pulled this off - we were blown away.

The bad: literally everything else. Director Kosinski is back, continuing his trend of not caring about humans in this clinically directed nightmare. Every character comes across as a stand-in, which leave you looking for superlatives for the word ""cliche"". (Cliche-est?) the dialogue is borderline parody, with my partner and I taking turns predicting the next line with shocking accuracy. Then, the plot is complete nonsense for a variety of reasons:

1. Really cool that Top Gun graduates are ""elite"", but... why not hire pilots with, you know, real world experience... like OLDER Top Gun graduates?! This is a serious plot hole that gets dumber the more you think about it. ""Let's hire talented rookies to fly this key mission!"" - why?!

2. Three weeks. That's how long the writers continuously emphasize these rookies have to train. Which, on its face, is already absolutely ridiculous - but then, the training gets SHORTENED - meaning that the hour of sequences you just watched, happened in... just a couple days? The timeline makes ZERO sense here.

3. Maybe, if you want us to care about our characters, you can help us understand the stakes? Pretty basic stuff. This movie is only a 2-hour first act, followed by the finale, where the team fight literally faceless baddies in the mountains somewhere. The rest of the stakes are petty, borderline-ridiculous interpersonal conflicts.

Everything coalesces into an ooze of bad, with a script seemingly written by a 12-year-old, acting so cringe it'll make you lose hair (stop TRYING so hard, Jennifer Connolly), and a soundtrack so gratingly sentimental it made us want to mute our speakers. The original Top Gun was a dumb mess, and I'm glad to see the sequel outdoing it in stupidity."

christyhunter,"Oct 10, 2022",9,"I wish I would've been able to see this at the theatres.
What a great movie! The summer of 1986 was one my GenX self will never forget! The most memorable thing that year was this little movie called ""Top Gun"". Over the years, I wondered if they would ever dare make a sequel & whether it would be as good as the first. Often, they aren't. This one was definitely surprising! I was very impressed.

I appreciated the current flying techniques, seeing the different types of aircraft, & following a mission.

I was also happy to see Mav find another love interest (and who better than Jennifer Connelly).

His tension w/Rooster was palpable & the Hangman/Rooster relationship mirrored his w/Iceman.

If I were to make any critiques, they are minor. I wondered during the span of the movie where all of Maverick's bravado & cockiness went. He was so sure of himself & arrogant about his flying ability in the original & deservedly so. I was so happy to see Val Kilmer in the film! I wish they didn't have him die, though. I kept hoping I'd see Slider, Cougar, Hollywood, & Merlin come back for the funeral. That was a bit disappointing, but overall, high marks for Vol ll of the Top Gun films."

If you grew up watching the first you will love this. If you were not born when the first one came out and found it later in life - you will love this one.

Top Gun Maverick (2022) : Movie Review -

Top Gun (1986) was a film that gave Tom Cruise a new image and a large following. It was a trendsetter for him, and probably the only second action film that got him a cult following for years after the Mission Impossible series. Tony Scott's aerial action drama was a huge hit at the box office, and people were wondering why the sequel wasn't made for years. Late sequels are usually considered unworthy, but there are a few exceptions. Now I can say, late sequels aren't worthy enough, unless it's Top Gun Maverick kind of stuff. The Top Gun sequel is too late, but it is worth the wait. I wasn't even born when Top Gun was released, but I have seen the film multiple times on TV. I recently saw it again to prepare for the sequel, and I can say out loud that the sequel has surpassed the first film. It exceeds all expectations, including the demand for scripts and advanced technologies. The age gap is filled very smartly and all the modern mass elements are put together nicely. Rather, I'd say, the action mania is much bigger and better than its predecessor.

Test pilot Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell has purposely dodged an advancement in rank to continue flying after thirty-six years of service. He is summoned to train a detachment of TOPGUN graduates for a specialised mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen. Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: ""Rooster,"" the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka ""Goose."" Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it. He meets Penny (Jennifer Connelly), a single mother, and starts a new love affair. With the help of Rooster, Penny, and other team members at Top Gun, Maverick eyes achieving an impossible mission.

Top Gun Maverick fulfils all the demands of the script, challenging the disadvantages of the late sequel. Usually, the late sequels go wrong with the main characters because they damage the main source material. With Top Gun Maverick, however, the scene is different. Peter Craig and Justin Marks take care of the writing department like a newborn child. They keep the essence alive and do not harm the main character. Even the new characters aren't bad at all. The entire team is fresh and looks like a perfect fit for the new story. However, the character of Penny spoils the rhythm a bit. What happened to Charlie (Kelly McGillis), the previous love interest of Maverick? Had they given a proper explanation to that character, I think I would have loved Penny's characters even better. The second bad thing about the film is its overuse of cinematic liberty on a few occasions. You can't accept a person to be clean and alive after his jet is shot high up there. Anyway, let's not give away any spoilers. The screenplay has a turbo speed and the overall writing still clarifies the mission in a foggy atmosphere.

Tom Cruise, the ageless fella. What charisma he has, especially with this character. It's a tailor-made role, and he measures all the corners perfectly. The new Maverick will make you fall in love with Tom Cruise again, and all that previous nostalgia will fade away this time. He sets the bar high this time, not just as an actor but as an on-screen persona too. I will never forget Miles Teller for his outstanding performance in Whiplash (2014), and recently he amazed me again with ""The Offer"" (2022). He plays a very predictable character here, who is in the backseat most of the time. This does not count as one of his finest roles, but he's not a big letdown either. Jennifer Connelly looks gorgeous, not better than Kelly McGillis, of course, but let's just forget that deliberated 'love interest character' for the sake of cinematic mass appeal. The roles of Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman and Ed Harris are well written and well executed. Val Kilmer may make you emotional with his cameo, while Lewis Pullman, Monica Barbaro, Charles Parnell, Jay Ellis and Danny Ramirez have got nothing new to offer, but fairly decent, indeed.

What takes Top Gun Maverick a notch higher is the big-screen extravaganza. The action spectacle is brilliantly shot and tremendously well edited. The aerial action scenes are truly breathtaking, whereas the background score literally stops your heartbeat for a moment. Watching Top Gun (1986) in today's time certainly makes it look updated, but the action sequences in this sequel are designed in such a way that you will enjoy watching them even after 10 years. Yes, there are a few cliches, the comeback and all, but it's a mass market product afterall.

Joseph Kosinski's previous outing with Tom Cruise - ""Oblivion"" (2013), came out as a terrible film. So, Top Gun Maverick is a terrific improvement for them. Joseph has a commendable job while dealing with the pressure of the sequel, nostalgia, and new-age improvisation. Top Gun Maverick is a top-class sequel for all the Top Gun and Tom Cruise fans out there, and the biggest credit goes to director Joseph Konsinski for that. He gambles with the idea of an aged legacy teaching something to new blood, and delivers an action-packed, blockbuster sequel by all means. Top Gun: Maverick is a big-screen experience that can't be missed. Do try to watch it in IMAX, and I'm sure it will be worth more than that expensive bowl of popcorn.

RATING - 7/10*"
sayandot,"Aug 24, 2022",9,"An emotional roller coaster with jampacked action.
Tom Cruise sir proves he is still the best action hero of all time even at 60. The chemistry between Jennifer Connelly-Tom Cruise and Miles Turner- Tom Cruise. Rest of the cast and crew are also very fantastic. This is arguably the best of 2022 along with RRR and Everything Everywhere All At Once."
shakercoola,"Jun 12, 2022",7,"Visceral blast of afterburner thrills
An American action film; A story about one of the US Navy's top aviators, who, after more than thirty years of service, dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him, is approached for a career-defining mission. As a long-awaited sequel to one of the top ten box-office successes of the 1980s, comparisons will be made with the original - in the sky it flew, on the ground it faltered; aerial sequences were arresting but it had a washout romantic pairing - but thirty-six years later it is not as thick with American exceptionalism, competitive machismo, and macho posturing, which made the original film distinctive but crude. Tom Cruise brings the same alacrity, if not the same vigour, but he has good presence. There's a return to the thematic cues and hallmarks which are enjoyable, but it doesn't retread the same story. A different theme this time - letting go of the past in order to move on - is simple, but it will be poignant and nostalgic for some seeing Cruise looking in on his past, in some scenese literally, facing his own advancing years - rolling back the years for a generation. All in all, it is formulaic and routine in plot with twists that creak a little when they force the envelope. But it is a first-rate cinematic experience without pretension, an exhilarating action picture with outstanding aerial footage."

darthfantastic,"Jun 5, 2022",10,"A movie that will inspire many generations!
This movie has a great balance between action, emotion and nostalgia. When this happens, it becomes more than a movie. Knowing how the original Top Gun inspired the generation of its time, this one will surely motivate not only this generation but future generations as well.

When the original Top Gun came out, I was only a child. After 36 years, as I get older, while struggling in life to achieve something that hopefully transcends my generation, seeing Top Cruise on the screen with the same Maverick character trying to achieve the same thing as he struggles in life touched me deeply at a different level. I felt the feeling of getting older while struggling to continue to be the best of the best despite all odds life brings. What Tom Cruise did on the screen to tell the remaining part of Maverick's story literally after 36 years, as he gets older, was no acting, it was real. And that's why this movie is unique and definitely worth watching."
JurijFedorov,"Nov 6, 2022",7,"Very basic by the numbers, but great flying
Good sequel, but plays it way too safe.

In a modern day where Hollywood is trying to reboot everything and modernize it so much that they remove all the simple brutal atmospheres of years ago it's nice that we finally get a proper sequel faithful to the universe of the past. Characters have not lazily been replaced for representation or to add popular young stars. We get Tom Cruise flying and fighting himself. Without this the movie just wouldn't work as it would be a reboot. We also get the same beats as in the original. To a degree where it feels like a remake at times. But they refer back to the original story that was quite a spectacular movie which makes this movie so much better as it feels like things matter. Because the new guys need time to grow on us. You can't just replace characters and think we will like the new ones automatically. Instead the movie relies on nostalgia and just builds on top of what the first one did while adding a bit new to it. Pretty smart idea.

We get fast flying, proper training for the dangerous mission, and Maverick doing stupid stuff in the air while being the best pilot around. Pretty cool. Especially the mission has some great dog fights. The movie knows what it needs to do. On the other hand it plays it extremely safe. It's basically the same story repeated and the scenes are rapidly flashing in front of our eyes. We seldom follow characters around. Scenes just come and go in short moments and we jump from location to location often even missing key decisions and events. Clearly this was a 3 hour long movie and script they cut down to 2 hours. This also means we are missing quite a bit of the storyline. They also lazily try to force in a terribly done romance that was unbearably cringe to watch. You need something for the women too, but at least make it well. This was clearly just plastered in to entice another part of the audience. For me it made the movie quite a bit worse. In the original the romance worked because it was part of the story not just outside the story.

Overall it was a fun watch. But it's a very basic action movie. There is not much dependence on acting, emotions, depth, relationships. It's some flying and the most cliche scenes you can imagine. The high quality flying on screen is groundbreaking though. We don't see this level of flying in other movies. You really feel like you are flying with them at times. Which really does make and save the movie. But in 1 week I will have forgotten much of the plot as it's just not that interesting or important. We for example never see the face of any enemy and never really see any conclusion to the pilots or their careers. They also don't have personal lives. I figured there would be some girlfriends and wives. Maybe some kids. Nope, zero of that anywhere. Just people who are good at flying. Right, that's fine, but you need to show us they are real people. You already put in a female pilot on this top team. Something that is not seen in real life. So do something with this character. Instead she is just a pilot. She could have been a man and nothing much would change except for a few jokes. They could have made her date someone and let us care so much more about her life. Maybe she has a son at home and has just started to date another pilot. That would make it more emotional. Instead they are just ... people. Just good at flying. It should have been more. But for a sequel it's way better than expected."
jk_99,"Jun 3, 2022",9,"Yes it really is that good
If you are fan of classic 80's movies like I am, you will love this. It's your typical 80's storyline of the bad guys are up to something and we need a hero to go and stop them, nothing else except that.

We have had a spate of bad remakes and sequels, so it's easy to think that this will follow the trend of poor movies that cash in on a name and introduce all sorts of modern language and concepts that many of us don't really like. This does none of that, it really pays homage to the original and gives us a new story with Maverick that gets you invested and makes you care.

Apart from the great performance from Tom Cruise who seems to defy age with a great performance full of energy and range, Miles Teller is the standout. He is truly believable as Goose's son, and that is key to why the movie works so well. The tension between the two underpins the plot. The flight sequences are also very well done, we really don't get movies like this anymore because drone strikes have made this kind of thing redundant so I'd forgotten how great flight sequences can be.

I highly recommend you go see this, it will take your breath away!"
Adeeb-ghazal,"Aug 25, 2022",6,"Nice ingredients for Tropic Thunder sequel .
Where to start from ?

To make it short : This was a nice nostalgic long video clip to follow up on the original movie, with amazing sound and realistic flight scenes, close to reality parameters and fighters performance ( although certain G force numbers are out of any standard and are exclusive to Tom Cruise)

There was no story , no twist , every thing is predicted( the reaction on their face when they found out the guy from the bar is the legendary teacher , really? , and the worst was the classic heroic sound track which I thought no body will ever use again , but unfortunately they did ..

This movie would be a rich material for Ben stellar to make ( tropic thunder 2) ."

Predictable plot, no stakes, CHEESIEST dialogue you ever heard, piss poor character development, boring plot, etc. This movie is such a waste of time. Was rolling my eyes at Tom Cruise's cheesiness.

*Top Gun Maverick*

*Top Gun Maverick*, an eight years long project in film making was completed in early 2020 and was to be released in July 2020 but due to Covid Pandemic the release dates changed 5 times. And finally the film hit the theaters on 27th June 2022. It was almost 35 years after the first film Top Gun released in 1986 which was my all time fav film and must have seen over a dozen times. The film had great actors' ensemble Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Tom Skeritt, Tim Robbins and a special apperance of Meg Ryan. All wonderful starcast. To add a more spice to the fast paced movie, it had a wonderful soundtrack and music composed by Harold Faltermayer and songs by famous singers and rock bands like Kenny Loggins, Teena Marie, Cheap Trick, Miami Sound Machine, Berlin (You take my breath away) and of course the great Top Gun Anthem composed by Harold Faltermayer.

With all this aspects, yesterday we went to see Top Gun Maverick, with so many questions in mind. Does the new film have all same starcast ? Except Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer. Was there any replacement of stars ? What about the soundtrack and music of the film ? How about the dog fight scenes in the films ? The excitement of watching the film was at its peak. Goosebumps all over during watching film. The film also gave a nostalgic feeling in the the opening credits and opening scene with same Top Gun anthem played as in the first film, Meg Ryan appears for some time in a flashback scene. There is a good and refreshing entry of Jennifer Connely and Miles Teller as the ""Rooster"". Tom Cruise the ""Maverick"" is fantastic as ever. Val Kilmer as the ""Ice"" gave brilliant and a small appearance. The dialogs between Maverick and Ice makes you emotional. There are fast paced and beautifully shot flight scenes of F-18 jet planes, partcularly the jets flying in the canyons and the dog fights and the ariel combats. The soundtrack of film is spendid and best part is that the original Top Gun Anthem is retained in the film. Hans Zimmer joins with Harold Faltermayer to compose the music, songs and the background scores of the film. All and all a wonderful experience to watch the film in the theater. For all those Top Gun fans out there, will find 3 types of Goosebumps, pre-movie, during the film and post-movie. A must watch film for all !!!!"

Raydio,"Aug 28, 2022",6,"Entertaining flight scenes, but little else
I had high expectations for ""Top Gun Maverick"", considering the hype and an IMDB rating of 8.5. But it became all too apparent within the first few minutes of the opening scenes, that this ""new"" film was basically a rehash of the original Top Gun, with updated aircraft and a lot more focus on Tom Cruise. The dialogue was mostly average, and often cringeworthy, and very cliched. But it's not all bad news either. The fighter jet scenes are nothing short of exhilarating, and you can see that a lot of effort went into filming them. Sound effects of the jets in action add to the immersive experience of this film. All in all though, I came away with the sense that I'd pretty much seen it all before (I just re-watched the original with my daughter before watching the new film), and the outcome was ever so predictable. I have no idea why this film is currently rated as the 58th greatest movie of all time. That's an insult to some truly exceptional films which are ranked well below this one. For a film to be ranked in the Top100 of all time I think it needs to be more than a mere 2-hour entertaining diversion, it really needs a solid script, engaging characters, and a story that that we might still be thinking about long after the hype dies down."

Giuseppe_Silecchia,"Jan 12, 2025",7,"A thrilling, emotional return to the skies with Maverick
Top Gun: Maverick (2022), directed by Joseph Kosinski, is a triumphant return to the high-flying action and emotional depth that made its predecessor iconic. Tom Cruise reprises his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, now a seasoned Navy aviator who remains a test pilot, dodging promotions that would ground him. When he's tasked with training a group of Top Gun graduates for a high-stakes mission, he finds himself mentoring the son of his late friend and Radar Intercept Officer, Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw, whose death has haunted him for decades. The film explores Maverick's struggle with his past, his fears, and his connection to the next generation of pilots, all while delivering heart-pounding aerial combat sequences.

The story, while familiar in its themes of redemption and confronting past demons, is brought to life by the powerful performances of the cast. Tom Cruise, as always, exudes charisma and emotional depth as Maverick, portraying a man caught between the thrill of flying and the weight of his past. Miles Teller, as Lt. Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw, brings a compelling mix of defiance and vulnerability to his role, effectively capturing the tension and unresolved grief between Maverick and Rooster. Jennifer Connelly also shines as Penny, Maverick's love interest, providing both warmth and complexity to her character.

The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing time for character development before launching into its exhilarating flight sequences. The aerial combat scenes are nothing short of spectacular, with breathtaking cinematography and practical effects that place the audience directly in the cockpit. The sound design and music, including the iconic ""Danger Zone,"" heighten the adrenaline of the action and the emotional stakes of the story.

Top Gun: Maverick is not just a nostalgic ride for fans of the original film; it is a testament to the power of personal growth, legacy, and sacrifice. The film excels in balancing high-octane action with moments of quiet reflection, making it both thrilling and emotionally resonant. While some of the plot beats may feel predictable, the emotional payoff is earned, especially in the film's powerful finale.

Rating: 7/10. A thrilling, action-packed sequel that explores themes of redemption and legacy, anchored by strong performances and unforgettable aerial sequences."
julieshotmail,"Sep 24, 2022",4,"A prime example of all hype, no substance
The handsome and always-bankable Tom Cruise gets me duped into shelling out $5.99 to rent this. After $1.4 billion+ worldwide gross earnings at the box office and nonstop heavy promotion, I feel compelled to join the bandwagon to revel in this cinematic experience. Fifteen minutes in, I am still giving the movie the benefit of the doubt that something ground-breaking is about to happen. Instead, the shallow, cheesy dialogue continues for the rest of the movie, making all of the characters one-dimensional, even Maverick. Why is Maverick so humble and smiling all the time while the rest of the characters are obnoxious braggarts? It seems that the budget is mostly focused on the set, props, and g-force training for the actors, and they've forgotten to come up with a good script and decent character development. The casting of Jennifer Connelly is a poor choice. Next to the charming Tom Cruise, she has zero charm and therefore there is zero chemistry between them. I should have read the bad reviews first before renting this, instead I trusted Tom Cruise and the movie's box office success, and now I'm $6 and 2 hours in the hole."

What a rush. This movie was just so much fun. So much heart. So many thrills. Edge of your seat moments. Rare you get all of these things right. I had a blast watching and cannot wait to watch again.

Every shot is iconic. You could pause this movie anywhere for a classic movie moment to frame. There's so many things to admire and soak in.

Tom Cruise. Enough said. The man will go down as a movie legend. Already was, but this movie shoots him into the stratosphere. His persona throughout, his guidance to the other actors. He's a real movie star. Up there with James Dean, Steve McQueen. A legend in his own right.

The effects, if you can even call them that, are insane. I've never had so much fun in a cinema. You feel like you're right there in the cockpit because the actors really are. Makes such a difference to know it was all shot for real. Will make it very tough for other airplane movies moving forward. Just breath taking stunts.

So it's an instant classic. One you'll want to share with everyone you know. Take your kids, grandkids, so they don't miss it on the big screen. Like Jurassic Park, it's a moment in film history to enjoy being part of! A must-watch, movie event of the year. Worth the wait! Thank you Mr. Cruise. Keep the hits coming!"

Top gun Maverick was amazing. The movie hit on all cylinders from emotion, nostalgia to excitement I was clapping one minute and crying another. One of the best I've seen in many years highly recommend it."
maynebrandproductions,"Jul 11, 2022",10,"Most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time
This is a must to see in theatres - I never write reviews but it was so refreshing to have this experience I felt obliged to share. Aside from the love interest in this one I think I even enjoyed ""Maverick"" more than the first Top Gun and that almost never happens with sequels. Bravo to the team and TC for making this happen."
maggymaytay,"Jul 6, 2022",8,"Everything you want from a summer blockbuster
Top Gun: Maverick is absolutely worth seeing in theatres - don't miss it! It's been a highlight of my summer and one of the best theatre experiences I can recall. The storyline is satisfying for fans of the original as it calls back to it many times, but the stunning element of this film is the epic flights, sound design. I was in the edge of my seat!

It's also quite funny in a few moments and definitely emotional too. It surpasses the sequel in every way. It's an uncomplicated, wildly entertaining romp that will make you want to go experience it in the theatres again and again. Turn your brain off and enjoy Top Gun! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
rjvmorgan,"Jan 16, 2025",10,"Continues from the original, and does not disappoint.
Top Gun Maverick is an amazing movie. Amazing action, great acting, and an atmosphere that can only be described as something so uniquely profound, despite being in settings we have already seen before. The story is strong and isn't overly difficult to follow whilst watching. I heavily recommend watching this film with the family, as for those who think action isn't their thing, will come to find that this movie was still such an amazing watch. The details, the visuals and the characters, all create an interesting and fresh feel, and make the whole movie experience more enjoyable, even if it is the sequel. It still brings new elements to the table. And I can definitely say that the music gives the same kick that it used too.

Please watch this if your considering."

The way it's connected to the previous movie is awesome. Simple story but every second is full of excitement and thrill. I'm gonna call it Masterpiece :Returned."
g_tunnard,"Feb 11, 2024",7,"Goofy but okay
The whole mission in this movie is taken from Star Wars A New Hope. Trench run, hit a small target. Don't think just do is just use the force Luke. Even the Han Solo character comes in at the last moment and shoots down Darth Vader just as the kill shot is about to happen. All they needed was Anthony Edward's to appear as a ghost.

Beyond that there was some good flying scenes and a whole lot of terrible dialogue. Cheesy though out but still fun. No idea how this movie got such great reviews. The story had no real depth. They had so many opportunities to build the backstory and they kept it one dimensional."
amariaaron,"Aug 1, 2022",9,"A superb story that doesn't lean on the first movie to be engaging.
This movie is the perfect example of how to bring back a long dead IP without relying too heavily on nostalgia. In a world with an over-saturation of superhero, fantasy, and ""one-man-army"" movies, this film is surprisingly human. It is a perfect blend of emotion, team-building, humor, tension, and the idea of facing your demons, both past and present. There was not a single moment in this movie where I was bored. The characters and the story beats included the typical tropes we see in media, but the execution was perfect.

Strangely this movie introduces a threat to America, but never gives that threat a name, which felt somewhat cheap. Also, more time could've been spent with characters other than Maverick."
claudejunge,"May 30, 2022",7,"A mix
It felt slightly disjointed.

The movie seems similar to a Best Of album.

They took all the best scenes they had and cramed them in that package.

They took the best out of the first Top Gun and included it.

The movie is often unrealistic. The movie is a giant Tom Cruise advertising. He had to be In in the end, although he knew better. The MI flair is too much.

The caracters are too glam to be true, too flattering.

But I do like many pieces, I do like the music at the beginning, I do like Tom's coolness, I liked many of the stunts.

To me the pieces don't add up nicely, but the movie is rather good if you like Tom and Top Gun."
farshadtami,"Aug 25, 2022",2,"Boring
1. I gave the movie an extra star because of all the fuel spent for filming those jets. So that star is mainly for the environment being such a hero.

2. Didn't they steal the plot from Star Wars Episode 4 the New Hope minus Darth Vader. There was the ""Use the Force, Luke."" part of the script, and even the ""enemy"" pilots looked like tie fighter pilots. So Top Gun is a tribute to George Lucas."

Disney pick up the notebook and start taking notes on how to make sequels.

10 out of 10 not because it is the best movie i have eve seen. (because it is not). Not even for the extraordinary performances. (They were great though.) The rating is because they managed to bring us the perfect sequel. The movie can stand on its own, whilst, in the same time it satisfies the first movie funs without been cheesy. (Except the first minutes maybe.)

What they have done filming the airplanes in action is out of this world.

In a time when every scene is computer generated (i blame superhero movies for this). It was an optical oasis in this computerized desert we are in for the past 15, and maybe more, years."

not_snobbish,"Sep 18, 2022",9,"truly enjoyed
I am an ordinary person, and I believe my feel would be typical of most ordinary people like you. An average, middle class person. I am well educated and in good career but I don't pretend to be high brow or snobbish. Nor do I care about what the actors, directors or producers say or do in real life. I go to the movies to be entertained, and how I feel after I come out of the cinema, is what my reviews are about. Honest, and I believe my reviews would resonate with most people. I hope my reviews would be a service to all you audience out there, to help you decide whether to go to see the movie or not.

Top Gun Maverick is a great movie with great action and emotions. A feel of real America. 80s style with no nonsense of ""half dark"" characters or confused people or jarring action.

It was after a long time that I saw a movie that is truly enjoyable (with exception of the fast and furious franchise which are always honest to goodness good and some of the mission impossible movies. Forget about the recent James Bond movies where bond is always unhappy to be 007 and always scowling!).

Many would agree with me that in last 10 years, studios have forgotten to make movies that entertain without guilt. Hope to see more movies like this - go to the cinema and come out feeling good."

The characters are one dimensional, the script is poorly written, the dialogues are cliché, and the love line is unnecessary. The only time I empathised with the characters was during flashbacks from the original Top Gun.

BUT all flight scenes and stunts are absolutely breathtaking. It's like you're in the cockpit with the pilots, impossible to look away. Overall, nothing like the first Top Gun but worth watching in the cinema."

It's better than the original and it's rare. Awesome, adrenaline-filled flight sequences. The ultimate summer blockbuster, and with a ton of emotional beats. Everyone is attractive in the San Diego sunset. Tom Cruise is so good in this, and I liked him better in this than the original. He's still the bona fide action hero, but aged with grace. There's a lot of emotional depth in his performance. His chemistry with Jennifer Connelly is great, which is not that common for Tom Cruise lol.

The last part of it was not very realistic, even through a lens of a popcorn movie.

Embrace it without cynicism and you will enjoy it thoroughly."
lobo_wolfspirit,"Nov 30, 2024",10,"Even waaaaaaay better than the original one!!
Top Gun: Maverick soars past its predecessor, delivering an electrifying cinematic experience that exceeds all expectations. This sequel is a masterclass in balancing nostalgia with innovation, featuring breathtaking aerial sequences that push the boundaries of action filmmaking. Tom Cruise reprises his role with charisma, but it's the emotional depth and character development that truly shine. The stakes feel real, the story is compelling, and the visuals are nothing short of spectacular. A rare sequel that outdoes the original, it's an exhilarating surprise no one could have anticipated. Absolutely brilliant!!!"
sinskiman,"Jun 4, 2022",9,"Top Gun: A True Maverick
This movie has you at Mach 10 from the get go. Another man versus machine idea, but this movie focuses on bringing an 80's classic into the 21st century, and it does it brilliantly. It had all of the adrenaline, machismo, and simplicity of the first movie, but with all the flashiness that new movies have to offer. Every time a character takes flight the audience flies with them and it will put you on the edge of your seat! The movies starts off a bit cheesy, but hits full speed once we return to Top Gun. Miles Teller does a great job as Rooster and Tom Cruise steps seemlessly back into the role of Maverick. There are plenty of look backs at the original movie, but the new crew feels fresh and new. Buckle up, because once Maverick takes flight, you will too!"

This is without a doubt the best film I have ever watched and the hype did not disappoint. We got to see hidden characters from the original film, as well as copied scenes with never equipment which makes it feel like you're watching the original all over again. Cinematography was outstanding, I'm not saying the acting and plot were amazing either but by god when some scenes of those aircraft came I was taken back by the beauty. In my eyes this film was perfect but maybe that's because I'm an aviation enthusiast. Perfect for anyone into aviation."

behnamrozitalab,"Sep 8, 2022",8,"A powerful comeback
An interesting thing to know about the Top Gun 2 movie review is that many people say that this movie is more about the actors and stars than it is about the fighter pilots. Because as we said, Tom Cruise is the main role in this movie and acts as an avatar. Watching this fascinating movie is like watching 37 episodes of Silicon Valley at once without even getting up from the couch. But are such films really needed? Another issue that must be considered in the Top Gun Maverick movie review is its direction. This movie was directed by Joseph Koshinsky and managed to show the invasion very well. This famous and successful director has also directed the movie Tron: Legacy and has a brilliant record in this field. For this reason, the making of such an attractive film by this director does not seem so strange. Some people think that Tom Cruise might not be able to play this role well; Because his age has increased and naturally he cannot be attractive and clever like when he was young. However, what we observe is the opposite of this. Even though Tom Cruise is approaching 60 years old, he is still as smart, charming and intelligent as the boy he was in the 1980s, and he manages to present himself as a skilled person."
user-176-46020,"Oct 5, 2022",10,"Call sign: ""Maverick"".
It's been almost Thirty-six years since we saw Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell on big screen. Tom cruise has redefined age, accuracy , & expressions. You will instantly fall in love within first ten minutes of the movie. Especially the background score is one again proven to be mass appeal to the audiences. I had to watch Top Gun 1986 one again before this movie which feels connected. So my advise is to watch both of the movies chronologically. Its saying that best movies are based on best books. This one is prime example of same which is said to be based on magazine article with the same name. So it's a GO...."
rannaluv-79-711891,"Jul 9, 2022",7,"7.5 for how the action scene at the end got me
So I'm someone who doesn't typically go for military type movies- and the original top gun was a film I slept through when I was a kid. I definitely had prepared myself to fall asleep again through this sequel, and I should note that I also lost a bet over what movie we would watch to my boyfriend, so overall I was not happy about seeing this movie (cue laugh track).

Then it starts. And I was like huh, okay there's something here. Then the training parts came and I go- huh, okay there's some comedy and some thrill- not bad. Then there was a good chunk of boring (sorry I just had a hard time paying attention), and the romance scenes were not as romantic as I would have liked (the bf didn't complain).

Then it happened.

The action everyone was waiting for.

The chase, the thrill, and the drama!

And I was completely engrossed.

The last 30 minutes of the movie had me glued to my seat, chewing my nails, and holding my breath.

So overall, not a bad bet to loose, and I left the movie theater telling myself to go see other films I wouldn't otherwise see. 7.5 stars."
stang_man,"May 30, 2022",10,"Outstanding.
Like many of the other reviewers here, I was 19 when I saw Top Gun. I was in summer school in college, full of dreams and idealism. Seeing this now at 55 after being married with adult children and all the life experiences that has brought with it, all I can say is; thank you Tom Cruise, Jerry Bruckheimer, Val Kilmer, and basically everyone involved with the making of this film (and the original). The love, dedication and passion put into this movie is obvious throughout. You have restored my hope in Hollywood. I hope you are working to mentor a new generation of filmmakers, since they have some awfully large shoes to fill."
Harry_Pamiaqui,"Dec 25, 2022",7,"Any rating over 7 is mere nostalgia and new toy excitement of.
With all due respect and recognition that Tom Cruise deserves, there is absolutely nothing special about this film. It has few interesting characters, just a little bit of action, and lack of air-to-air fight with the enemy so the fighters would show off. Any rating over seven is mere nostalgia and new toy excitement of. Red Tails, who presented a better adventure of superior realism and quality, got a 5.9. The 1986 predecessor was even more interesting than this movie is. Even so, it was a hit because it shows detail of new air combat technology never seen before, and that was it. Once again, they forgot that the characters are professionals, unique people with unparalleled skills, and present them behaving like pedantic children. At that level of execution, there is an atmosphere of respect and discipline that does not occur in civil society, possibly why writers have not been able to recreate it."

Playing ball on the beach with your best buds at sunset, taking your best girl home late at night when everyone else is asleep, downing brews in your favorite bar with your pals (nobody is ever lonely in the service), looking sharp, getting decorations, standing up to The Man, being All You Can Be: these are some of the daydreams of teenaged boys, lying on their beds, fingering their acne pimples. This dull, pedestrian talkie has the usual explosions to relieve the tedium, but its view of warfare is very reassuring. If you get in trouble, a fellow American will show up and save you because you're part of a team, and don't worry about those vodka-swilling Ruskies (they can't fight; they're snoozing most of the time). I half expect this show to be on TV eventually, interrupted by commercials for T2T (Tunnel To Towers), showing a wheelchair bound veteran demonstrating how his new stove goes up and down, so he can make himself useful by preparing dinner for his family.

This is probably one of the best movie in recent years, I can't remember a movie as good as this since Batman The Dark Night. The dialogue in this movie was incredible and it goes back to old film making where we don't need characters talking every second or explaining the plot to us. The cinematography is incredible with the footage of planes and you can really appreciate this isn't all CGI and that Tom Cruise is actually flying that plane, if you even look at his face in the scene's. The music chosen in this movie conveys all sorts of emotion and makes you really invested in characters and feel the tension.

I probably wouldn't have gone to see this one in the theater if I hadn't heard it was getting such a good reception. Totally worth it. Sure, the plot and the characters are pretty predictable, and they certainly went in on the nostalgia (but not too much), but it's all done so well, you're totally taken along for the ride.

david1806,"Oct 1, 2022",7,"7.5 / 10 - Entertaining for sure.....
So, I haven't even seen the first one (or if I did, it was so long ago I can't remember it), and it has taken me awhile to bother watching this one...not really a genre that interests me. But what is not to like about seeing jet planes shooting through the air at Mach 10.... WITHOUT the use of CGI, but the real thing. And wow, you certainly can tell.

The thing that impressed me most was the lack of ""The Message"" being shoved down my throat - Hollywood take note, this is what people want, not what MCU/Disney is churning out now...forced diversity and all that nonsense. Just a good ol' fashioned story. I am hoping that the ""Woke Go Broke"" message is finally getting through to the studios - it ain't what people want.

Anyway, back to the movie. Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. I always love a bit of Jennifer Connelly, and I thought Miles Teller was excellent in War Dogs - I am surprised he hasn't become more well known...well he certainly will be now! It was great to see the real thing on the screen, rather than CGI - it really does make a difference. I am a bit annoyed with myself for not getting my act together and seeing it at the Waterloo IMAX theatre in London - I kept meaning too. However, seeing it on my massive TV still did the trick, but I can imagine it would have taken the movie to another level seeing it with IMAX (is that ""with IMAX"", or ""on IMAX"", or ""in IMAX"" ...?)

So if you are like me and not really a fan of gung-ho action movies, turn off ya brain and go see it anyway - it's a blast!!"
allanharley01,"Sep 4, 2022",3,"Seriously?
Even as nostalgic schmaltz this is a TERRIBLE film. It trades enormously on Top Gun, which has not stood the test of time, whilst also drawing the worst elements of other film tropes in - Star Wars (wamprats/ Deathstar), Dambuaters, Independence Day anyone? - but adds nothing new. Tom Cruise is... Tom Cruise, and, yes, has a little running scene. Everyone else is reduced to a sub-Battleship cypher - and that was based on a boardgame ffs. The only memorable element is a truly awful moustache, and even that is a copy... I don't mind bad action films (I've seen the aforementioned Independence Day and the follow up multiple times and enjoyed them, even when sober) but I don't think that applies here...

Giving this 3 stars, most of those are for Val Kilmet, and the rest are to provide royalties for the 80a."

This isn't a simple war movie, this is a drama and a romance and the young hero journey and ""how to cope with getting old"" story, all rolled into one, written so well that every one of these aspects is woven tightly with the others into a tapestry that is life.

This is an exception to that particular rule !

For a kid growing up in the 80's, movies, imagination and minimalistic joys, we're all we had.

Top Gun was a classic. You talk of top 10 80's films, that bad boy is up there. It had everything you could want from that era.

When modern day cinema tampers with the fabric of cinematic innocence from the 80's and tries to re-create, re-boot or ""modernise"" it, it usually falls foul.....by a long way.

That was until Top Gun : Maverick graced us with its presence on the big screen !

The world, as we know it today, is horrible. Everywhere you look it's a place with not much joy but for just over 2 hours, Tom Cruise and it's wonderfully collective cast gave us this absolute gem of a film.

It probably won't win any Oscars but my god it gave us the film of the year hands down so far and will go down as a great. Better than the first in my opinion.

Going back to top 10's of the 80's.......this bad boy goes in to my top 10 OF ALL TIME !!!!

I didn't think with this review.... I just did !"

Great cast, perfect to premiere Memorial Day Weekend where you left extremely glad and proud to be an American! One of the best sequels of all times and, quite honestly, better than the first. The movie score was very good, the cast was excellent and Tom Cruise never disappointed. The whole family can go to this one and not worry about having a 'woke' agenda shoved down your throat. It should get Oscar nod for best picture. Who knows, people might start watching the Academy Awards again."
Geekofriendly,"Jun 4, 2022",9,"Tom Cruise's love letter to Cinema
""Top Gun: Maverick"" is nothing short of an INSTANT cult classic and a much-needed cultural phenomenon for the modern cynical age!

While the trailer looked surprisingly impressive, Tom Cruise in a movie about an ageing jet pilot didn't exactly scream relevance. Boy was I wrong! This is not a competently made cash-grabber, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is what happens when people who love what they do put their heads together to try and make a great movie for the audience.

The last time a movie made me leave the cinema in SUCH GLEE was way back in 2012 when ""The Avengers"" took their deserved center stage. I can only conclude that (the living icon) Tom Cruise, (the always on-point) McQ, and the (never again) underrated Joseph Kosinski have MASTERFULLY HACKED into the collective subconscious and gave the world EXACTLY what we didn't know we so desperately NEEDED.

The entire cast and crew achieved the impossible and not only made ONE OF THE BEST SEQUELS EVER (!), but the movie itself is a LIVING EXAMPLE of everything that we have been missing in movies for the last 10-15 years: viscerally real practical effects; a delightful throwback into simpler, saner times; and unapologetic fun.

Hollywood will undoubtedly take notice, but only a handful of smart copycats will fully comprehend that this movies's magic formula is ANYTHING BUT EASY. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is so darn good PRECISELY because it was NOT easy to make, because the cast and crew had to invest real-life sweat, blood, and perhaps even tears to bring it to life, because it doesn't pander to the audience.

It looks like the effort will be rewarded as Tom Cruise's love letter to cinema is on track to become one of the biggest box office blockbusters of all time. I couldn't be happier!

Yes, the movie that had no right to be very good turned out to be phenomenal. I just might revisit the local cinema."
arothschild-586-967335,"Sep 29, 2022",6,"Moderately Entertaining Sequel
As much as I enjoyed the original, the sequel is simply a tired copy somewhat updated for the times. That having been said, if you are looking for excellent cinematography and great stunt flying, this is your film.

But the times have changed since the original was made. Whereas star power and Tom Cruise's charisma still are worth their weight in gold at the box office, and although this film has a heart, it is lacking a soul.

In times such as these, much more turbulent than the relative calm of the late 20th century, movie-goers should want and expect more from a feature film.

This was simply eye-candy for those who enjoy films pitting the United States against an evil adversary. We all deserve better than this. We need film-makers to produce films that have a soul as well as a heart."

Joseph Kosinski's 'Top Gun: Maverick' is a blockbuster sequel that while doesn't always soar but flies higher than the original.

montagnard-13345,"Nov 23, 2022",2,"Hollywood Has No New Ideas
This is another attempt to ""remake"" a classic movie. Pure BS. Hollywood is brain dead, nothing original, just remakes. This movie is nothing but feel good BS. In this movie there are so many highly unlikely scenarios it is an insult to anyone with an IQ over 75. It is a cross between a flashback and wishful thinking. The characters are 30 years Maverick's junior and are testosterone jocks who play games with one another. They may be serious pilots but act like juveniles. All uniforms are ridiculously tight, no uniform fits like a glove on people of different body shapes. The flying parts are okay but lack originality. Nothing but car chases with airplanes. Although it contains some ""entertainment"" value, generally IMHO it isn't worth the time to watch. I think watching paint dry or the grass grow has about the same value. The original movie was okay, but this is an insult to that movie. This reminds me of the Rocky or Rambo movies. Remake after remake. After the first iteration, the remakes are disappointing. Same here."
Hypno_Catalyst,"Sep 27, 2022",9,"Good action fun
Having loved the original Top Gun, this was a must see. A little unrealistic (how does one survive a mach 10 disintegration of a plane without a scratch?) and the plot with Rooster was just so obvious, but the flight scenes were just amazing - enhanced by the fact that the cast really did experience that flying and a year of training. I did wonder why they fired Tomahawks at the airfield and not the SAM sites and why the countermeasures against radar-guided SAMS were flares and not chaff - would have made it so much easier to do the mission - but hey - it would have made a less-exciting film. A thoroughly enjoyable watch."

So far this film has done better than the original which doesn't usually happen when a sequel is produced. That says something.

I love how they took their time with writing the story, it was so well done and such an incredible plot. The film was delayed like 2 years if I recall, I remember watching the trailer years ago. But I can tell you that it was well worth the wait.

Everything about the flying, cast, cinematography and visuals were stunning and mind blowing. I don't think any film will be able to recreate such a masterpiece. The camera work was perfect and I had never felt so immersed in my life!

The screen time didn't feel short either and what I love is how the second half was un-predictable and not expected what so ever. My heart was racing and the thrill feeling was incredible. My friends Apple Watch was literally warning him to lower his heart rate!!!!

Overall, It's a masterpiece. A well made film that I would happily watch anytime. Yea Avengers Endgame is good but not compared to this cinematic experience. Top Gun: Maverick definitely deserves higher reviews."

Save yourself the bother of watching this one and watch the original movie it blatantly rips off, Iron Eagle 2.

Not only does IE2 have better acting and a better cast but the dog fight scenes are also much superior.

Both movies have the same plot and practically the same script. The difference between the two is the references to TopGun shoe horned in to Maverick.

It's a nostalgia cash grab that offers nothing new to an audience.

""Missles are a direct hit. Runway destroyed"" ""That will stop them launching fighter planes""

bijupillai73-1,"Jun 2, 2022",9,"Spellbinding Maverick!
One of the most exhilarating, pulse pounding, heart thumping experiences in cinema! It's the kind of action spectacle everyone wanted. Craved for! Tom Cruise is back to entertain us galore! He isn't retiring any time soon. To compare Tom Cruise with other actors, I can say or even sing.....""They don't make make them like they used to....""(Kenny Rogers). Tom is of a different breed altogether. I have never seen as actor give his all like this for movies. His only motto is to entertain the hell out of the audience. And he does that with elan!

A sequel to the 1986 movie named ""Top Gun"". A sequel that upped the previous movie and how! I probably watched the old one in the same year 1986 or 1987 on VHS. I read that it received mixed reviews from critics but the audience lapped it up and was a huge commercial hit, grossing $356 million against a production budget of $15 million in 1986. Now that's wow! It's soundtrack too was very popular with ""Take My Breath Away"" by Berlin being the numero uno song then. As well as Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins.

In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".(Source - Wikipedia) I revisited the old Top Gun a day before I went for Maverick. While watching Maverick, I realized what a good decision that was!

When the makers conveyed the idea of a sequel to Tom Cruise, he wanted it to have a solid story as well as real aerial stunts. No vfx! The challenge was accepted with Tom himself designing a training guideline for the actors. Tom Cruise is a certified pilot also. Their full on dedication and hardships can be felt in the aerial shots! The stunts by the highly skilled aviators! My God, do they invoke your deepest fears and excitement of flying and speed! Sheer adrenaline. Dopamine overload! WOW! WOW! JUST WOW!

About the cast, once again, Tom Cruise was outstanding in his portrayal of ""Lt. Pete Mitchell"" aka ""Maverick"". He brought back his boyish charm as well as his hell-bent on proving himself attitude even after 36 years from the incidents of the first movie. Yes, age has caught upto him just a bit (it shows a little on his face), but what a powerhouse of an actor he is! Whatever he did when he was 24, he does much more at 59! An array of emotions were at display convincing us of why he is a bonafide star. One of the biggest movie stars on the planet! John Hamm as Vice is terrific as well, in a role quite detached from his very popular character Don Draper in the television series Mad Men, yet you see the shades of a no nonsense determined man in authority. Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic! She was enticing as Penny Benjamin, an old flame mentioned in passing in the 1986 ""Top Gun"" by Goose (Anthony Edwards) and his wife Carole (Meg Ryan). Her character wasn't shown in the first part and back then it was more about ""Kelly McGillis"" as Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood, instructor of Top Gun and Maverick's love interest (She isn't mentioned at all in this movie). In this movie, the makers perfectly blended in Connelley's character and I found that both Tom and Jennifer had great chemistry with each other. A mature ""been there done that"" chemistry as aged adults. Perfect! To bring back Val Kilmer / LT Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky was a nice touch. Again the way they included him in the story was perfect. The emotions it evoked brings me back to what I mentioned initially (about watching the first part a day before I went for this one). Which made me relate and adapt into their world the moment the beginning credits came on. A few flashback scenes from the first movie, stirs up your emotions for sure. When Rooster (Goose's son) sings ""Great balls of fire"" sitting at the piano, we are taken back (Maverick's flashbacks) to the scene at the same place where Goose and Maverick belts out the same song! Oh man, that one pulls you all the way in!

The young pilot trainees/graduates played by Miles Teller (Lt. Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw - Son of Goose), Glenn Powell (Lt. Jake ""Hangman"" Seresin), Lewis Pullman (Lt. Robert ""Bob"" Floyd) and Monica Barbaro (Lt. Natasha ""Phoenix"" Trace) performed well. 1986 Top Gun was an emotion. Top Gun : Maverick is intense and soulful.

The music/score are terrific. ""Hans Zimmer"" never fails to amaze and make us fall in love with his music. Kenny Loggins' 1986 hit ""Danger Zone"" is which was a massive hit back then, is used in the opening credits of Top Gun : Maverick, just like how it was in the old movie. Oh, that was a clever move to get the fans invested in the movie from the get-go! The moment the jets begin to take off from the decks of the aircraft carrier, the song sets in and nostalgia hits us hard! You might know that the 1986 ""Top Gun"" soundtrack was one of the biggest-selling movie albums of all-time. So it was natural for the makers to use it again! But the other classic song, Take my breath away"" wasn't used this time. In place of ""Take My Breath Away"",by Berlin, Top Gun: Maverick gives us a new track from Lady Gaga,""Hold My Hand"". It sounds and feels like a classic number full of love and emotion. Beautiful. The reason Director Joseph Kosinski gave was that, the ""Take my breath away"" song was made for Maverick and Charlie in the old Top Gun. For Maverick and Penny, he needed something new and as good as the old one.

Spectacular cinematography! Kudos to Claudio Miranda. I can't even think as to how he/they did this for real! (I did watch the making of the aerial stunts recently). Tom impresses us not only in his acting chops but in action as well. Though the action here isn't hand to hand combat, he really is flying the jets here. The F-14 Tomcat, Boeing F/A 18E/18F Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, Sukhoi Su-57 Felon and a fictional Hypersonic ""Darkstar"" Jet Based On Lockheed Martin SR-72! The ""Darkstar"" flying scene to be watched to be believed! And finally the North American P-51 Mustang, which is actually Tom's own personal plane used for the movie! Beautifully executed aerial stunts, taking us along for the ride when you watch it in IMAX! You actually feel like a co-pilot! That shows how immersive the experience is! Tom riding his Kawasaki Ninja H2 Carbon is just awesome! The same bike he rode in the first Top Gun. Racing the jet just like the old movie. As well as riding it with Jennifer Connelly! Iconic shots!

Top notch editing by Chris Lebenzon and Eddie Hamilton. Despite it's 2hr+ runtime, it never felt stretched at all. And I'm sure they guys had a lot of fun editing the aerial stunt scenes! I heard in interviews and read that little to no CGI was used and everything was as real as possible. Which itself is a feat in these times!

Top Gun : Maverick has action, drama, romance and humor...all in the right places and in the right manner. Beautifully shot. Well scripted and acted. People who haven't watched the original Top Gun, I say you must, as it will definitely connect emotionally with you in the sequel. And what's a Tom Cruise movie without a running scene! Yes, you a few angles of him running through a snowy forest in this one.

You all know what a crescendo is, right? It's a gradual increase in volume of a musical passage. It brings up the excitement in the music as it nears the end. This is what you feel in Top Gun : Maverick. The crescendo towards the finale! A spellbinding, nail biting extended climax that cannot be forgotten very easily and you have to see it to believe it! I did sway my body and head at times as I got so immersed in the aerial combat! Sensational!

The movie has a few expletives/profanities but no actual adult content (a sensual scene between Maverick and Penny is done tastefully without the need for nudity) A side note : TOP GUN MAVERICK shot 800 hours of footage, as much as the three LORD OF THE RINGS movies!

And the 2h 17m we got from those 800 hours is pure gold!

Fans and cinephiles alike.... Rush to the cinemas preferably IMAX) to watch this spectacle on the biggest screen possible, before it ""flies"" away and ""lands"" on OTT. You won't regret it one bit! (But do watch/re-watch the 1986 ""Top Gun"" before that)."

mailsids,"Jun 3, 2022",10,"As good as it gets
1986 coincided with raging teenage hormones and an impressionable age. And Top Gun left an indelible mark and wisdom on cool quotient. Suddenly it was all bomber jackets, bikes, and aviators. And if you were on the right side of the 80's, chances are that this movie was on your legendary list.

Maverick offers a smooth transition, an entertaining pace sublime enough that it engrosses you before you could realise that this movie came 36 years later. And In the age of incessant run of the mill sequels with plot encased in the ridiculous and CGI's being the norm, this was a much needed breath of fresh air at sea level.

Interspersed is the familiar Tom Cruise pace with by far the best aerial aerobatics you would have ever seen. This is entertainment at its very best and manoeuvres between raw emotions leaving you animatedly involved all with sweaty palms and hammer fists. And for all those who cared enough for the first part, there is this surreal homecoming of the F14 Tomcat woven nicely into the script. After all this is where it all started. I had a few tears which I wiped off at Mach speed .. because Top Guns don't cry :)

Sometimes sequels are good and then there is this.. legendary!"

heisenberg12,"May 26, 2022",7,"Good Sequel to the 80's Classic
So I just walked out of the theatre catching an early show of Top Gun 2: Maverick. This is going to be an honest and fair review for people curious to just how good the movie is (as that is what my biggest question was).

First off, I'd like to begin by stating: this is not a ""bad"" movie at all. It's not bad, so you can get that right out of the way. That leaves the question: ""Just how good is it though?"" To answer that fairly, it must be broken down into pros and cons.

Let's start with the pluses (pros). First off, I personally need to say that Jennifer Connelly alone is an absolute mega-bonus to this movie. For all of those JC fans out there, you will not be disappointed. In fact, I don't know if this is a beautiful movie, or if Jennifer Connelly's face makes it a beautiful movie, but I'd lean more towards the latter. The final result, however it is equated, though, is a beautiful movie.

Next, we'll give a plus (pro) to the nostalgia factor. While an objective critic or someone who never saw Top Gun (1986) would be less interested in this and perhaps critical of it, it was definitely a strength of Top Gun: Maverick. Every single time there was a callback to Part I (1986) or reference or appearance or mention of the Part I characters, it really worked in the movie. Nothing felt overly forced except for maybe one small moment toward the end so it was nice to see them tie in a plotline to the original.

Thirdly, let's talk romance and return back to Jennifer Connelly. This was another solid addition into the story. It added to the human side and emotional side, and I think without this balance of it, the movie might have suffered by being overly reliant on the air and flight scenes.

In discussing the pros, the final thing to mention is the action scenes. While I didn't think they were immensely better ""overall"" than Top Gun (1986), the final mission sequences were incredibly intense. Intense is the perfect word to describe it. You will be glued into your seat, unable to move while taking in the air acrobats towards the end.

Probably the best part about TG:M is that it is truly never boring except for a brief moment toward the beginning. It has that feel that you can't miss a minute. This is probably due to the tight editing. I had to go to the bathroom from the first scene, but I held it in the entire movie so I didn't miss anything. That's how fast it moves. It is very entertaining and fast-moving. The 2 hour, 10 minute runtime truly does ""fly"" by, no pun intended.

Now, unfortunately, I have to be honest and admit that there are cons, and like many overly hyped movies, some of them are related to expectations and the movie being hyped so much before going in. This is subjective, but for me personally, I had heard some people who had reviewed TG:M early make claims that ""it was WAY better than the original"", it may be ""nominated for Best Picture"", and ""this is Tom Cruise's BEST movie"". To each their own, and I'm not judging the people who said these things because they may really feel that way because they liked the movie so much, but I would have to be honest and say that claims such as these are a little bit of a stretch, in my humble opinion.

This by no means is to say the movie is bad. It's good. But I can't fully agree with these sensational headlines or claims I've read or heard. Now, to be fair, Best Picture is ultimately determined by competition for that particular year (and in recent years up to 10 movies can now be nominated), so it's not impossible, but if it came down to a conventional 5 nominees, this definitely probably wouldn't make the cut even though I wish it did because that would be cool. The one BP-level quality that it would have if any at all that might draw in voters is the emotional components. This movie will ""move"" you, mostly thanks to Connelly, but it probably won't be enough to get a nomination and many action movies also have the same ability and still don't get a nomination (even the 1986 movie had emotional aspects to it and that didn't get nominated). One category I do believe TG:M will have a great chance of winning is in Editing, and maybe it has a solid shot at sound and song (just like when it won for that category in 1986).

I also don't believe this is Cruise's best movie ever or even in his top 5, maybe even top 10. Controversially, I think he was better in Part I than in this. And believe it or not I still like the first one better. That concludes an analysis on the cons in terms of expectations.

My biggest criticism of the movie on its own is simply that I thought that it could have been even better. I understand the big budget and they're limited on logistics and what they can film, but I felt like: as good as the ending was, I had an idea for something even better, and because this is a Spoiler review, I can say that it would have been cool if all 4 partners were still in the air in an all out dog fight (and I actually thought this would be the end result based on preceding scenes) with the enemy jets rather than only Mav and one other companion.

I also have to mention and complain about how Hangman came out of nowhere for the final splash when last time we saw him he was still on the Aircraft Carrier and called off so as a viewer, you are left wondering, ""where did he come from?"" We get it. He pulled a ""Maverick"" and disobeyed orders probably, or Hamm changed his mind, but they should have showed this so it wasn't sort of cliche. But to be fair, look, I get it, it's a movie and it is plausible that they sent Hangman. It's just that they should have showed it so it wasn't one of those shootout cliches where the hero comes out of nowhere.

One final criticism is that some of the acting, only at certain times, could have been better. And I think Part I had better acting overall, even from smaller roles. But this movie has to be taken for what it is, which is a fun summer movie just to have a good time at.

TG:2 is rated PG-13, and sadly they are mostly aiming at teenagers for some of the big moments in the script; the good news is that it is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, containing far less cursing than the first Top Gun and even less graphic love scenes (by far). There are handful of s words and one f word at an intense moment, but overall it is very mild compared to the first one. There is no nudity or intense sex scenes, but just innuendo on the romance side.

As a whole, TG:2 is a very enjoyable summer motion picture. If you have any interest in the movie, you will laugh, cry, be thrilled, maybe even feel patriotic, and be interested in the military logistics presented for the missions. Cruise does his best at an older age to nail his lines, and while maybe not possessing the charisma that only a young, 24 year old hot shot rising movie star could display, he certainly carries the movie with a commitment to the role. A shout out must also go to Miles Teller, who is sufficient as Goose's son.

If you are looking for a fun summer movie, anticipating the nostalgia for the Top Gun 1986 hit, want a theatre movie that the whole family can enjoy, or you simply like a well-made mixture of drama, action, and romance, you really can't go wrong by giving Top Gun:Maverick a watch on the big screen. However, I would recommend lowering expectations going in to see it so you aren't expecting it to be an Oscar winner or Cruise's best movie ever. It is definitely a good movie though. How good? That will ultimately be more subjective with this movie than any one I can think of.

I was in my teens when the first movie came out. At that time, there was no social media, internet and mobile phone as there is now. I remember like it was yesterday that I was mesmerized when I watched the movie ""Top Gun"" in the cinema and even hung a poster of the movie in my room. A lot of my friends (including me) started to dream of being pilots. I sewed crests on my denim jacket. Years passed. Some of our elders, who took some of us to the movie, have passed away, some of us now have young children.

I was excited when I heard that a sequel to the movie that left such a mark in our youth years would even be shot. Even when ""Danger Zone"" started playing in its very first scene, I was shivering.

It would not be a lie if I say that the film is an invaluable blessing for a fan like me. A lot of effort and time was spent. If possible, I think it will be very enjoyable to watch in 4dx screen. It is definitely a movie worth the money you will pay to watch it in the cinema."
toroancho89,"Jul 8, 2022",10,"A beautiful reminder of why we go the Cinema
I'm 33, I wasn't even born when the first movie came out, but it's a classic, and if you like movies, you can't not watch it.

Yesterday I took my mom to see this sequel at the movies and, my god, what an incredible movie. It has that thing about good stories that inspire; Top Gun Maverick makes you laugh, cry, reflect, it even makes you want to get on a plane and be there with the actors.

This is the best sequel I've ever seen. Period.

The flawlessness in continuing the original story, keeping the same aesthetic, recreating iconic scenes is the perfect way to tell THIS story.

Hollywood lost its way a long time ago, but it is these kinds of movies that remind us why we go to the cinema; because we want to get excited, we want to feel adrenaline, cry, laugh, we want to be part of the story for those 2 hours that we are sitting in the chair.

And Top Gun: Maverick is exactly that. Do not miss this gem."
cduchaffaut,"Jun 3, 2022",10,"Expected a poor cash grab, left with an amazing movie.
I honnestly thought going in I would just see a poor cash grab of a movie, with no substance, plot or actual writing. But this is an amazing movie. Truly one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And I truly encourage you to watch this, as it is filled with humour, emotion and action."
jquentin-35510,"Jul 3, 2022",10,"Funny, thrilling, entertaining, and above all nostalgic.
Top Gun: Maverick not only pulled off the rare task of surpassing the original film, but it did so in beyond epic fashion. From the storytellingto the actors. From the camera work to the music, and even the comedic moments were on point.

Everything fit in perfectly and far better than in the 1986 film (in my opinion). Gave me a series of thrills that I don't often feel while watching a movie. And it is for that, that I must proclaim this as easily among my favorite movies ever, and despite it just being July, I am calling it right now for this to be the film of the year.

Love him or hate him, Tom Cruise certainly knows how to put on a good movie."

amitgaharwar-66290,"Jun 17, 2022",10,"Danger Zone!
Its a marvel and a tribute to the 1988 OG. The intro gives you goosebumps as it takes you back to the OG, same opening sequence with Danger Zone throttling through your veins! That line aviators call it TOPGUN! Shivers!!! Chills!!!

However, Tom Cruise takes this one to an another level. He is old, he is greyed but boy he has not lost his style! He carries the film on his shoulders. Be it the air sequences or dialogues or acting! This is Cruise's film. The support cast though delivers a solid performance.

The air sequences are just Wow! A special callout to the opening sequence: the Mach 10 and the climax sequence. The climax giving tribute to the OG by bringing in the F-14 Tomcat. There was hint early in the film that the Tomcat could make an entry. But one couldn't be sure!

As a fan who grew up seeing the OG on VCR, DVD multiple times. This was a fitting closure to finally see the TOPGUN on big screen!

May Maverick live long enough to make a sequel!!!!"
AfricanBro,"Jun 7, 2022",7,"Haven't seen a movie like it in a while
I'd been putting this on hold since it came out because I kept telling myself I need to watch the first one first but it wasn't happening so I just went into it blind, still enjoyed it. My first thoughts was about fixing the plane; why do mechanics, car or plane, often work with white t-shirts or vests on and always get them stained with oil, it's not a top gun thing but it's the first time I've noticed it. Anyway, the movie itself is great, was expecting a decent film but it's better than that, it's like a good old blockbuster, it's really just an action movie; I was concerned at first because in recent years most movies have had to have comedy element added to it but top gun sticks to being just top gun and I like that. Goes without saying that Tom cruise is much older now but he proves he still has it in him, the opening act was so blood pumping and it's the exact feeling I assume the first movie had.

It's not only that though, action aside there're a few stories going on, Maverick and Goose's relationship with his father as well as maverick and Penny's relationship and all these made the movie surprisingly heartfelt which I didn't expect; not sappy but it carries some emotion. I found the amount of action quite limited though, most of it's crunched up towards the end and is amazing, I just think I misled myself going into the movie thinking it was going to be World War II level action for some reason. After thinking about it I realized it sufficed. I haven't seen many movies like it in a long time, reminiscent of 80's blockbusters. I don't expect it to snatch awards, it's just a fun watch and I think that's why. I absolutely loved the casting.

I used to dream of being a fighter jet pilot and this reminded me why I thought it was so cool. Unfortunately it didn't leave much of an impact on me, I think it is a good movie but a forgettable good movie. It's still definitely worth a watch especially on big screen. On a side note, the scene when admiral Cain shows up as the jet's taking off right above him for test flight was so badass, my man didn't even flinch even though the shock wave shook everything else."

Kyashan74,"Mar 2, 2023",6,"Mediocre at its best
I'm amazed from the great success this movie had and by the so many positive reviews, there are movies that are 100 times better than this that not receive a similar treatment, i think something is wrong in people capacity to judge about when a movie is good or not.

This movie was entertaining, that's ok, the combat air scenes were good, that's true, but the overall plot and acting was something mediocre.

I never been a great fan also of the old Top gun movie, but even that was probably a bit better than this, at least that one got a masterpiece song in it.

I'm not even brutal as other reviewers and i still gave this a six stars, but i honestly don't think it deserves anything more than this."
audreympauls,"Mar 16, 2023",1,"Hard to Watch
Laughably awful script. I felt like I was watching a teenage mutant ninja turtle movie written by and for boomers. The script was so dated that I kept wondering if the movie was supposed to be set in the late 80's (it's not - it's supposed to be set in 2019). There is absolutely no character development at all, and little to no plot. The action scenes were fine, but without any substance, even those were pretty uninspiring. It was less of a movie and more of a montage of scenes to show how cool Tom Cruise thinks he is (it's clear that he is one of the producers). I do not understand why this movie has such high ratings, maybe I'm missing something, but it definitely wasn't for me."

ryanpethrow,"Sep 10, 2022",9,"Top Gun: Maverick-Captivating, stunning, unique, adrenaline-pumping, and emotional film masterpiece! Tom Cruise proved again that he is the biggest in Hollywood!
At first, when I found out they were going to make a movie like this, I thought it was unnecessary, but since Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors, I still thought I would watch it when it came out! Then, I found out that it was delayed because of the pandemic, that there were changes, and I thought it would hurt the quality and the script. I even read that it could go straight to streaming, and I thought that would totally ruin the movie.

Finally, after a lot of delay and Tom Cruise's stubbornness, the movie was released in theaters. It happened! The movie finally came out in theaters, and then I was very pleased and surprised at how everyone reacted to this movie. The movie became a legend while it was still in theaters! It brought incredible revenue and became Tom Cruise's highest-grossing movie, and I was extremely happy for him because he deserves it, because I think that Tom Cruise is one of the best actors I've ever seen, and he is extremely dedicated to making movies!

I didn't watch it right away when it came out. I watched it on Blu-ray first, and I loved it so much. I fell in love with this movie so much that I went to see it in theaters (they were still showing it) and watched it five times within a month. It had not happened to me in a long time to see the same movie so many times in the theater! What can I say about Top Gun: Maverick that hasn't already been said? An absolute masterpiece of cinema. The aerial combat scenes are the best I have ever seen in a cinema! The acting is amazing, the actors are great, and Tom Cruise is unique as always.

The movie is beautifully shot, filled with unique, captivating, stunning scenes, and the plot is very well made and polished, but the icing on the cake is the appearance of Val Kilmer as Iceman. This makes the movie great, and the meeting of Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in one scene is extremely emotional, to such an extent that I would define it as one of the most emotional meetings of the last 15 years.

I was extremely excited to see Val Kilmer after his battle with the insidious disease, and his presence is still as compelling and strong as ever. The film deservedly received such an incredibly high rating and brought in such revenue, I personally think that Tom Cruise should finally get his long-deserved Oscar, and for this movie he deserves not only an acting Oscar, but also for film of the year, as a producer!

Tom Cruise once again surpassed himself and proved that he is one of the most dedicated actors and producers in the USA, if not the most dedicated to his audience! If more people were like him, there would be many more quality and stunning movies! If you haven't seen Top Gun: Maverick, definitely watch it, but the experience is even more stunning in a cinema, especially in Imax! Top Gun: Maverick is an enthralling, breathtaking, unique, shocking, adrenaline-pumping, emotional masterpiece! I would define it as the film of the year, and it is definitely in the top ten films of the last 15 years! Tom Cruise proved again that he is the biggest in Hollywood."

tom-hobson15,"May 23, 2022",10,"All hail Tom Cruise!
I adore Top Gun, and have seen it over 100 times, can recite it word for word, and is the reason I'm a pilot. I've never been so excited for a movie. Not even for Endgame or the collosal disaster; Die Hard 5.

I saw this on the 21st May in Macau, 4 days before it's European realease.. ... Odd. Hence why it's the first review.

I was excited / nervous for it to do well, but I had faith in Tom Cruise's dedication to his craft, and perfectionism.

He delivered! And then some!

A perfect sequel.. the opening had me giddy with glee, giggling and cheering and fist pumping the air in the cinema.

The movie has everything. The flying is sooo amazing and real, with the actors really pulling those Gs in the aircaft. With Real character development for Maverick, some sad moments, and a beautiful inclusion of a not well Val Kilmer. A nice new personal journey for Maverick to navigate. It has So many links to the original, and the perfext balance is struck between nods and homage to the original film vs ripoff and copycat ala Hangover 2. It has everything.

If you know the first movie well you will have alot of moments of 'oh that's just like that bit' and 'ooh is he gonna say that, or do this' a lovely experience to live.

The finale had be squirming in my seat flying every twist and turn, clenched, excited, riveted and scared. It's almost like Top Gun meets Mission Impossible.. we also get the obligatory Tom Cruise running scene 😅.

It doesn't repeat the story of the first one, but continues it into something else, that's entirely different yet very familiar. Maverick faces more challenges this time around on a personal level, and the love interest story is in keeping with a character his age who's lived his life. He is also more badass this time around.

With characters like Rooster (have a think about that one) and Hangman, a kinda Iceman, Maverick rolled into one.. you get taken on a new journey for the movie, for them, and for Maverick himself in last chance saloon.

It's obvious that it can't have the innocent 80s charm of the first one. That era is gone and making a retro movie would feel weird. But it's in its own era, it owns and embraces that, and makes the most of it too, with Tom Cruise and his mega productions to great effect. No using the same shot repeatedly ala Top Gun. Theyve got a tonne of flying and it's all concurrent.

Eveything you want to happen happens. It's emotional, amazing, triumphant, sad, and fun (in no order!). A stunning movie, that could not have been better. Don't think this kind of movie can or will be done again. Stunning. Such and achievement.

I will go again to the movies with my kids.. and feel like I should go a third time, to make it my most watched movie in the cinema over Endgame. Sit back, strap in, get some tissues, and don't forget to breathe!"
Christopher_Reid,"Jul 4, 2022",10,"Amazing flying visuals, engaging themes, lots of action and heart
Maverick is just a really great movie. Other than the amazing visuals, it doesn't do anything too special. In fact, that's kinda the point. It does what every action drama tries to do but actually does it well.

It made me realise something about cliches. They're not annoying simply because they're overdone. In fact, now I don't even think that's the issue. It's because cliches are often done with no skill or sincerity.

Maverick has all the cliched moments you could expect in such a movie. The tension between young and old, men and women and tough and quiet guys, the guy who breaks all the rules and the higher ups whose blood pressure increases as a result, the suspenseful action scenes where characters could die at any moment, the smartarse comments, the teary memories, various comedic moments, etc. But all of them work and they work really well. They feel fresh despite being familiar. Why? Because it's done well and it's done with sincerity, not obligation or sappiness.

Where Maverick excels is the gorgeous flight shots. Cruise apparently insisted on doing everything for real, Nolan style (they should really collaborate), and it shows, big time. I really feel like I've never seen a movie quite like this. That aspect felt like it was truly pushing the bar for movies as an art form. You CAN make realistic and amazing action scenes without it devolving into frantic, messy cutting and a predictable plot.

I'd like to see this approach with other kinds of events. As in, the same level of attention to detail, respect for characters and themes, etc. This is easily the best dogfight movie of all time. It has raised the game. Like The Dark Knight raised superhero movies, for example.

It's funny, I gave Top Gun only 4/10. I really didn't like it. It was kinda boring. I couldn't follow the action. I didn't care much about the characters. And there were lame, dated 80s songs throughout. But now I feel like I should rewatch it at some point. Even if just to understand this movie a bit more.

Overall, I found Maverick riveting from start to finish. I really cared about the characters and the themes resonated deeply with me. Breaking the rules in the right way, you might say. Righting wrongs from the past. Staying true to yourself. Transcending expectations. Trusting your instincts.

The music was good, the acting was good, the story was solid, though fairly simple. The strength is the amazing aerial cinematography and the countless gripping moments throughout. It all meant something. There's no flab. And it doesn't shy away from tough questions. I truly didn't know what would happen in the climax - and I cared! That's how movies should be!

I really like the Ace Combat series of games for Playstation and this movie reminded me of them. The mission actually makes sense. And the movie makes it *really clear* what has to happen and how difficult it is. It also gives us a sense of the dangers involved but also a sense that it might be possible. It all ramps the tension way up for the big finale.

Two final things. During the action, you can really clearly see what's going on. It's easy to follow. You feel like you're right up there with them - because they really are up there! And the action just keeps delivering. It had every right to end at various points, but it just keeps going on. It's not good, it's great. It's a really, really great movie. I can't wait to see it again!"
FeastMode,"May 29, 2022",6,"A throwback to 1980's movies
This is a slightly modernized version of the original. It has the same essence and feel, which is impressive after 36 years. It's enjoyable and mostly well-made with certain scenes living up to the term ""blockbuster."" It's definitely worth watching in IMAX, especially with the expanded aspect ratio.

The flight scenes are once again fantastic, with the only flaw being too many cuts instead of holding on a shot. The story is investing with some good heart. The musical score is awesome. Tom Cruise somehow continues to do his own stunts, which adds a realism that we don't see as often these days. He even has a running scene like in so many of his movies. But I can't blame him, he's really good at it.

On the other hand, I'm generally not a fan of 80's movies so that aspect didn't do as much for me as it will for others. And some of the nostalgia stuff feels a bit forced. They still memorize and sing the same songs 36 years later?

In the end, I had a good time with this movie. Big fans of the original will love it, and casuals will be entertained. (1 viewing, early screening IMAX 5/24/2022)"
SeriousMayhem,"Aug 29, 2022",10,"Wow, I'm impressed. This is how you make a blockbuster.
No, actually: this is how you make a MOVIE.

I'll keep it short and sweet: Top Gun: Maverick is great and easily among the best I've seen in recent years.

It has a little bit of everything: drama, tension, action, comedy, and all of it is present in perfect quantitities. No shoehorning in political views or other preachy woke nonsense.

The direction from start to finish is amazing.

The flying scenes are awesome in every aspect; it's as if you're flying with them up there.

I fear this review might look like one of those glowing 10/10 bot reviews we see too often on here, but ""it's the only one I've got"".

If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out. 9,5/10, rounding up!"
a_lowther,"Jun 3, 2022",6,"i do not understand these reviews
If you're taking into consideration all great films this is a 6 at best.

The first 2 minutes are fun then it immediately gets boring and predictable. Instead of using the new characters to drive the plot they make us revisit tom's character who hasn't grown since the last movie and we throw goose's son in to move him forward except it's not well done it's just cheesy and boring.

All the time spent in the planes is absolutely sick and 10/10 action. But the other 60% of the film is about a 3/10.

The plot was predictable and very 'destroy the death star with 2 rockets'. I can think of 4 plots more interesting than what they went with. They should've focused on the younger characters but instead they spend 20 odd minutes on the worst stuff with cruise and connelly.

I get it's a fun good summer film. But everything everywhere all at once is a 9/10 and on the same scale this is a 4/10. Criminal for people to be rating it as high as they have."

Tweetienator,"May 27, 2022",8,"Fine Flight
Top Gun: Maverick is a good sequel to the original, with some spectacular dogfights; a fine production and solid acting make the piece whole. I also dare to say, that most who like the first movie will like this one too. The greatest con: what Maverick mostly misses is an interesting story. The story is of very simplistic nature, a very basic one that we all - in whatever context set - watched a zillion times before. For sure Maverick is good pop-corn cinema with some fine moments, and tasty for the right audience, but not as good as many reviewers here on Imdb claim boldly. In my opinion for example, The Edge of Tomorrow is the far stronger movie - it got good acting, a fine production, lots of action and spectacular visuals too, but, last but not least, a well crafted and superior script (compared to Maverick). Exact rate: 7 + 1 for the spectacular visuals. A fine flight, but not an excellent one."

I saw this last night on IMAX, which for this movie is a must, the sound and picture quality is pretty essential. I thought the original was great fun, a little bit too homoerotic, but well made with great flying sequences. A movie I loved as a kid in the 80's but got less enthused as I aged. This movie beats the original hands down, and I would put it in my top 10 sequels. The flying sequences are the best anyone has ever seen on celluloid, the story is a clever one, which I won't spoil, but is full of little surprises. The cast are all great and the directing from Joseph Kosinski is amazing. I'll go to the cinema 40+ times this year and I strongly doubt I'll see a better blockbuster in 2022. Well done."
reddiemurf81,"Jun 19, 2022",9,"Don't think. Do.
(If you haven't seen the first movie,, you obviously didn't grow up in the 80s or 90s.

Do yourself a favor and watch it first.)

Pete Mitchell, call-sign Maverick, has spent over 30 yrs as a pilot in the U. S. Navy. He has received numerous combat medals, as well as citations, and does everything he can not to get promoted beyond the rank of Captain (bc he doesn't want to be grounded). He currently works as a test pilot for military warcrafts. After disobeying a direct order from his Admiral (portrayed by Ed Harris), and reaching Mach 10 (!!!) in the special war aircraft he was testing,, Maverick receives orders to return to TOP GUN!!

Upon arriving at the naval training center, Maverick is told that he was recommended by Admiral Kazanski (Iceman) for this special op. He'll have 3 wks to train the schools top graduates to fly an impossible mission.

The 12 top pilots (all about the same age as Maverick when he came to Top Gun) arrive to the base, and one of them just happens to be Lt. Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw,, Goose's son. (If you still don't know who Goose is, he was Maverick's co-pilot, best friend, brother from another mother, etc,, who died while ejecting from the cockpit of their plane as it spun out of control)(GO WATCH the first movie!!) As soon as Rooster sees Maverick, he's obviously (to the viewer) not happy to be flying under his command. (Later, we find out that Maverick pulled Rooster's papers/applications from flight school. Setting him back 4 yrs. Maverick did this at the behest of Rooster's dying mother.) Will Rooster forgive Maverick?

Will Maverick be able to teach the pilots what they need to know to complete and survive the mission?

I remember seeing the teaser for this over a year ago, and my first thought was ""No!"" Why are the just now making a sequel?!? Why are they dredging this up only to make some terrible sequel in the 2020s (so far,, I haven't been a fan of this decade). Well,,, I couldn't have been more WRONG. This is the EXACT kind of summer blockbuster our country needs right now. American fighting men and women in the US Navy taking it to the enemy!!

Cruise, despite his abnormal ideas, is an iconic movie star and he brings it better than ever in this one. Where Maverick was a hot shot pilot in the first movie (yes, pun intended seeing as how the first Hot Shot movie was a parody of Top Gun 1986), this movie sees him as that guy with several more decades of living and loss under his belt, and rather than thinking mostly of himself, his main concern is teaching these pilots how to survive their mission.

Val Kilmer, despite losing his voice to throat cancer, brought a lot to the scene he appears in as well.

The younger cast members couldn't have been better imo. Miles Teller has always impressed me, and I really bought that he could've been Goose's son in this.

Not to mention,, Jennifer Connelly!!! Wow she was great as Maverick's love interest. Jean Louisa Kelly plays Iceman's wife, and she was great as well. (Two beauty's who only get better looking with time,,, 😍😍😍)

I didn't think a sequel coming in 36 yrs after the original could possibly be good, but I'm glad to say that this surpassed the original (and that's really saying something) by a good bit."

Groverdox,"Dec 21, 2022",6,"I didn't get it
I didn't understand why this movie is so celebrated, nor why it was the highest grossing movie of 2022. It certainly does seem to be the case that ""old is the new new"" - the second highest grossing movie of the same year was a Jurassic Park flick.

It could be that this is one of those movies that you need to see on the big screen to really appreciate. I watched it on my computer.

It was exactly what I expected: lots of fancy footage of aeroplanes spinning around and flipping over, and a totally quotidian plot when we get back on the ground.

I just couldn't get interested in it. Why is it supposed to be so good?"
danieljfarthing,"Aug 29, 2022",8,"A brilliantly shot, fitting (though not flawless) sequel to an old great.
As sequel to 1986 blockbuster ""Top Gun"", the spectacular ""Top Gun: Maverick"" was a long time comin' - but worth the wait. Tom Cruise is terrific again as the 'maverick' jet-fighter pilot come reluctant instructor (under the likes of Jon Hamm, Ed Harris & old pal Val Kilmer) to the cream of the new gen (inc Miles Teller) who he must prep for a 'mission impossible'. Jennifer Connelly is wedged in as a love interest (having apparently replaced Kelly McGillis over the last 36yrs) but this is really all about the jets, which are stunningly shot (like the rest of the film) by director Joseph Kosinski. Wonderful, old-school, polished blockbuster fare - a fitting sequel to an old great."
mladen982,"May 31, 2022",7,"As good as it could get in present day
Original was US Navy draft add but blow up because of music and stile like a hallmark of the times. There was no point to sequel except usual motives ($) and as sequels go this is a very smart movie in regard to how it was constructed. They new exactly what people want and would like to see and gave them exactly that. But they also know not to overdue it with nostalgia. So, a good mixture and as title goes its a movie centered on Tom and he is again that character, so no passing the torch thank god. Most of other characters are ok but bland and forgettable.

Main dramatic conflict of the movie is lame but you have to have something. That is also a big problem for me, this movie is even less realistic and more silly then the first one. ""The army"" is not strict at all and is all ""hugy"" and ""feely"". It has no ideological preaching sub context almost a given for present day and that's a good thing. Its not even a draft add like the first one, there is not as much ""America, yeah!"" moments as you would expect.

Biggest disappointment in the movie for me are highly praised flight scenes. They are not that impressive with just identical closeups from front and lots of fast passed shaky cam. Arial shoots of original in my opinion are far more impressive and believable. End mission is also silly and unbelievable but that doesn't matter. The point of this movie and what audience wanted to see is Tom Cruise being Maverick again and kick ass and in that regard it completely delivers."
danielcereto,"Jul 27, 2022",1,"Top Cheese
I can't believe this movie is scored as 8.6, seriously I don't get it. I was expecting an action masterpiece at least, but instead I found a forgettable movie including a lot of weak points.

First, the movie is super cheesy, predictable and the story is super simple. No surprises or twists from beginning till the end.

Second, characters are extremely stereotyped and not well developed. Looks like more a buddys movie than anything else.

Last, the nostalgia from the 80's doesn't really fit with generation Z. Everything looks really forced most of the time.

So overall, if you love predictable top chessy blockbusters this one is for you. Go and watch it and score your 10.

If not, try to watch some real 8.6 movies: Seven, The silence of the lambs, City of god and Saving Private Ryan. Enjoy."
jackgdemoss,"Jun 23, 2022",9,"Suprisingly phenomenal
I wasn't a fan of the first Top Gun film at all, and I planned on skipping this because of it. I generally shy away from decades later reboots because they are trying to make a quick nostalgia buck. I can confidently say that this isn't one of those movies at all. Every shot and practical effect is oozing with attention to detail and heart. The sound track is nostalgia bait, sure, but it is still objectively an absolute banger.

Miles Teller is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors working right now. He and Cruise are given beautifully written characters to work with and they do not dissapoint. Top Gun: Maverick is a proper blockbuster that reminded me how important extra effort for practical effects can make."
BrnzReviews,"May 27, 2022",10,"""A Need For Speed"" Top Tier Sequel
This is it, the moment we've all been waiting for.. Top Gun: Maverick! Tom Cruise makes his long awaited return as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, facing his reckless past as he takes on a new team of Top Gun trainees. I thought this was probably one of the best sequels we've had to a classic in years, these days it's all money motivated with no real emotion behind their craft but this is not the case for Top Gun: Maverick.

It was so great to see some familiar faces return like the incredible Val Kilmer reprising his role as Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky, without him I don't know how I would of felt about this, although his screen time was not long, it sure was impactful and I thought it was beautiful they writ into the story his real life struggles.

This is no ordinary journey, no ordinary flight. This film is the one I'm calling movie of the year to date, something really good has to come and take this spot, the fighter jet scenes were so intense and realistic (Tom Cruise actually got everything on point to the point of filming in real jets with real pilots) this man is something else.

Highly Recommend, don't pass up this opportunity of Top tier entertainment, be sure to catch the first Top Gun beforehand."
Kimal9000,"May 26, 2022",10,"I have only given a 10 to two movies before...
...and none of those were action movies. But this is a ten, whichever way you look at it! This may be the only action movie I've seen that deserves that rating. With the possible exeption of David Camerons ""Aliens"".

Tom Cruise only get better and better! And his movies only get better and better! Where will this end? This movie improves upon the original in every department, and that's immensly impressive for a 60 year old competing with his twenty-something star-self!

Top Gun: Maverick is real movie-craft done the right way, not just pushing buttons on a computer. And yes: Humans can tell the difference. (I remember in the eighties when electronic drums came around, and every artist began using it on record! And after a while, they didn't.,,, I suspect CGI effects are going the same path. Sometimes you have to use them; But when it is possible to do it the right way, call Tom Cruise ;) After watching this movie I got a feeling of gratitude and love for Tom Cruise; he must surely be the hardest working movie maker in the industry these days! He cares about every aspect of the craft, no compromise! The man's unstoppable! And thank God for that!"

joanaaguiar40,"Dec 25, 2023",6,"Flat plot, missing attention to detail
The fact that no info was given about the ""enemy"" at all made it feel like it wasn't a real battle but a staged performance or videogame. Even if animosity isn't the most important point, it felt fake as if driving the other planes, fighting on the other side, aren't real people. About the mission we only got to know the trajectory of the planes and their job but there was no backstory.

The main plot, between Mav and Rooster was consistent and the two actors had interesting chemistry. On the other hand, the love story felt rushed and the female character felt like a prop. The love story, although secondary, isn't supposed to feel like a box checked from the Hollywood movie guidelines but the lack of depth, kind of made it look like that.

Finally, all the actors used too much makeup it really through me off. Between that and the fake tan, they definitely didn't look like they were on the job as pilots in the navy. Felt staged and amateur, a classic Hollywood mistake though.

The effect are now much better than in the first one, but that's just a consequence of the evolution of technology, yet it made the movie makers lazy, they relied on the great visuals. At the end, the first one may be less grandiose in terms of effects, but it makes up in authenticity."

Sees All,"Jan 31, 2023",7,"Classic Hollywood Entertainment
I had no interest in seeing this movie (I'm usually more of an art film fan) until it was nominated for Oscars in several important categories. And it's playing in my neighborhood, so I decided to check it out. Boy was I surprised! TOP GUN MAVERICK is the kind of movie Hollywood is famous for: glamorous people doing exciting things while giving the audience thrills and chills and suspense with an upbeat ending. Hollywood has been in love with aviation from the very beginning. The very first Oscar for best picture was WINGS, about pilots in World War I. Audiences were thrilled by its daring arial photography. With the technological advances of 95 years, the arial sequences of TOP GUN MAVERICK are even more exciting. The story is one that has seen many incarnations over the years: the old timer is called back to action in order to teach the young people how to do it. But has he lost his chops? Will he win the trust of both his superiors who are almost hoping for him to fail, and the young people who consider him a bitter has-been. Yeah, we've probably seen it before, but never as spectacularly thrilling. It's also a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The movie has been a record-breaking box-office success worldwide and it's easy to see why. It's nothing terribly profound, but extremely entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it."

They had 30 years and they couldn't come up with better script? It is as generic as they come! Camera also no that impressive. Usual shaky cam and too many action close-ups for a movie ""made for big screen"". On realism side also laughable. So many impossible maneuvers, specially with that hypersonic prototype. Nonsensical behavior of everyone and specially the mission profile. IRL mission would be done with just rockets. So decisively childish 2 brain cell script and just a propaganda for air force. Really nothing special. Actor performances are good but with dialog this cheesy- does not result in anything impactful."

Tom cruise yet again showed that how well he understands the cinema and audience. Every thing about the movie clicks, the music, the character, the nostalgia factor and the love for planes.

It has the soul of original film wrapped in with the experience and technology of today, topped by Tom's performance.

The casting was impeccable, every actor is the face of the character and they do justice to the role. Be is iceman or ed haris with screen time of less that 5 mins.

Music is another dimension where the movie excels. Every time you hear the clannnnnng sound, it runs from your head to toe. Background music is appropriate and demands you to experience it in the movie theater.

I must have watched the trailer more than 15 times and was waiting for this eagerly and believe you me. This does not disappoint. And it shows why Tome cruise is sitting on top of the pyramid.

It is indeed a love letter to aviation."

This movie combined all the greatness from the original but ramped up to current times with more action and so much suspense. The flight scenes with Tom Cruise and all the actors are completely stunning and because they are real they grab you and pull you in. It's been a while since I watched a movie and literally was on the edge of the my couch, shaking my leg and cringing. A lot of people don't like Tom Cruise due to what is reported about his personal life, but I always enjoy his films and I think he is an incredible actor.

The team developing Topgun 2, made their research, pushed the right buttons, considered the audiance's expectations and played very well on everything they did.

Tom Cruise did a phenomenal job, and I could see his hand throughout the whole movie. He does things to a superior and unmatched level. What blew me away most in this movie was how REAL it was. The footage of the aircraft carrier, the footage of the birds (F18's and other aircraft), the realistic plot and storyline, the emotion and relationships, the unpredictability, and the humor and drama. Every element was REAL.

Every bit of Top Gun Maverick is moving, and thrilling! I went back and forth from the edge of my seat, to nearly crying from emotion-evoking scenes, to gut laughing along with the entire theater; all of these things I did MULTIPLE times.

miha-kusar,"Oct 16, 2022",7,"Outstanding cinematography and action, terrible cliches
This movie is epic and spectacular and deserves to be seen, but only because of the action scenes. I did not notice any CGI watching it and that is unbelievable. Acting is fine, no major complaints. The plot is pretty unbelievable, but all right, it's an action movie, can't expect them to go overboard here.

But you could not fit any more cliches in this movie if you tried. Just one on top of another, the writing at times is on the same level as fan fiction, except someone has thrown tens of millions of dollars at it. The writing is not bold in any way, it clings hard to the first movie and the political correctness is up to 11. There are far too many ""establishing shots"", dull, predictable dialogue for me to really enjoy it.

And if we rate the film based on what experience it gave us, then compared to, say, Interstellar or The Matrix, Top gun: Maverick cannot be rated nearly as high.

Is this what we want the cinema to be? People rate it 10, saying it's the most epic blockbuster ever and throngs of people agree. Really? With such dull writing? Let's hope this doesn't become the norm."

Top Gun MAVERICK was superb and it did everything it said on the tin and more. So if you watched the original then you would know it had all the hallmarks of the 1986 cult classic .

It's far better action and the dog fight traning sequences are spectacular, stunning , breathtaking etc etc , an absolute must go see movie if you like war movie navy action .

Definitely exciting and entertaining, adrenaline pumping through the veins while watching the movie. Incredible visuals during the flying scenes. However, it is still american heroes with good teeth, athletic body, snarky comments, winning yet another victory against evil forces of foreign countries. Our hero doesn't care for the mandatory army protocols and orders from his superiors and listens to his heart and this disregard is never punished. He does what he thinks is fit. This is a repeated cliche which has no place in an organization supposed to honor artistic motion pictures in my opinion."
BabylonBlonde,"Aug 27, 2022",3,"I'm very confused about the high ratings
This was yet another sequel of an old classic that nobody really needed. I was really looking forward to this movie by the way, until I started watching it.

Acting feels very forced, robotic, and has zero realism to it, the same with dialogue, incredibly cheesy and it made me cringe. The entire film seems more like an ode to Tom Cruise who appears to want to prove that he still got it (lots of shots showing his arms, chest, putting t-shirt on, playing shirtless on the beach etc). Tom, you're a legend and you don't need to do that.

What I'm super confused about are the multiple reviews giving this film 10 out of 10 and people reacting with anger whenever some critic (there are very few of them) dares to say they didn't like it. It's a very similar situation to Black Panther which was a b class /straight to DVD movie but got critically appraised because of political climate.

You need to suspend your disbelief like you've never suspended your disbelief before to watch this film, which for viewers with a modicum of brains is a tall order. The action is beyond ridiculous, may as well have had superman fly in at the end to help out (although funnily Amazon recommended I watch superman when the credits rolled, lol)

That said, at least there is a measure of plot unlike in Top Gun. But like Top Gun this is a blatant and shameless military PR and recruitment exercise now drenched with lashings of nostalgia.

The majority of the film is a scene by scene reworking of the original; set pieces, soundtrack, characters (where willing), locations. The script is threadbare. The acting is fine, although nobody is finding their talents stretched here.

A lot of people seem to really like it though, I don't quite know what to make of that because empirically it's not that good a film. I guess after the pandemic, multiple military defeats, political fractiousness at home, a general loss of international standing and status the American public (some of them at least) want to feel good about their country and military.

We packed into the small hometown theater with the most amount of people I've seen in years, there were four generations in the theater that day, from young kids to great grandparents.

After 2 plus years away from the cinema; we finally got tempted back to the IMAX to see Top Gun Maverick. And we were not disappointed. A touch of romance, compassion and a massive dose of action that wasn't over laden with CGI ensured we had a great experience and a reminder that our 4K 55"" TV isn't the answer to all our movie dreams

Tom Cruise and cast brought together emotion and great acting that was not overshadowed by the exciting visual content of real life action. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate CGI and the worlds that it opens, but the raw energy of seeing real jets in action and Tom Cruise in the cockpit adds dimension that takes the film away from what might just be an elaborate computer game. I have no doubt CGI was incorporated, but I could not see where it was added, other than they didn't blow up the aircraft

Whilst it is great that everyone has different views, I do not understand some people giving this film 1 or 2 stars. If that's how they felt after watching the film, surely they should have read the synopsis before they went. I can only think these people don't like action movies at all and should have saved their money in the first place, rather than bleating that they were ripped off

Thankfully the vast majority of people enjoyed themselves and this movie will help save the cinema and get people back into seats. IMAX viewing isn't cheap, but we came away feeling we got value for money and I for one, hope the movie receives well deserved Oscar nominations."

Cruise absolutely smashes it outta the park, from the soundtrack to the characters, action scenes, quality and flow of the story is incredible.

jonathanfirby,"May 27, 2022",6,"Maybe my hopes were too high but I was let down
The original had everything. A believable story line, great characters, dog fights and whilst a serious script it had some classic one liners. I know it off by heart having watched it over 100 times.

TG Maverick abandons all of this other than the amazing flying scenes - in fact that is the only thing that saves the film.

Far too many nods to the original - it got cheesy by the end.

The script was like something out of Mission Impossible. In fact that is what the premise of the film was - an impossible mission. But with this impossible mission everyone came home apart from poor Ice Man who's death and funeral only took about 24 hours - probably the fastest in US history.

The first half of the film felt empty as we caught up with what Maverick has been up to for the last 20 or so years but in reality we didn't learn much. The last half was action packed but only just managed to save the movie.

I'd have loved to have spent less time with the Maverick catch up, less time with the shoehorned Penny Benjamin and more time learning about the pilots. This could have been a perfect segway into a 3rd Top Gun with Rooster and Hangman taking over the Maverick and Ice Man rivalry.

I desperately wanted to walk out of the cinema having loved it - I wanted to text all my mates saying how good it was but I couldn't. I rattled off a couple of sentences surmising the plot to my wife and realised how silly it all was:

Maverick is a test pilot or a secret plane - he takes it up against orders and blows it up - doesn't get sacked as Ice Man conveniently phones up as it happens and brings him back to Top Gun for an impossible mission that no one else in the world can train people for - he trains them - gets sacked - steals a plane and completes impossible mission - gets his job back - flies impossible mission - gets shot down without parachute opening and is fine - Rooster saves him - gets shot down - they meet up and steal an old plane - shoot down 2 super jets and save the day - then they land and they then make up and work on planes together.

I don't know, maybe I'm being harsh. Knock 30 mins off the start with all the Maverick and Penny stuff and it would have been pretty awesome.

Will probably watch it another 99 times."
oivinx,"Sep 7, 2022",9,"Best action flicks in a very long time
A weakness with action films is that they often do well in the story department, but fall apart when the action itself starts. Not so in Top Gun: Maverick. The action sequences are anything but an afterthought, and are both impressive and easy to follow. I re-watched the original Top Gun later the same day, and in my mind there is no contest - Maverick is a better film in almost every aspect. Action-wise this is the best action film in recent memory, but it does have some minor flaws.

The dialogue feels a little contrived at times, especially between the side characters. It's not bad per se, but a little over the top. Enough that it will take some people out of the immersion.

My bigger gripe perhaps is the half-baked romance side-plot. It doesn't add much to the film, but at the same time I'm happy that it doesn't try to take center stage and lets the flying be the focus.

All in all, Top Gun: Maverick is a fantastic action film that does not compromise on the action and flying elements. The stunts, cinematography, sound design and nostalgia are all on point. This is how you do a rehash, simple as that."

thomasjonmcl,"Aug 1, 2022",9,"One To Remember
Top Gun: Maverick is just a fun movie, taking great lengths to ensure a truly cinematic experience, Tom Cruise's attention to detail and passion can be felt throughout. I'd never seen a Topgun movie before, but this just made me a fan. Maverick abandons the idea of capturing the feeling of a time period like how its predecessor did. OG Top gun is filled to the brim with 80's energy, while Maverick feels more timeless, harkening back to the past instead of living within it, and of course, it does, it's a sequel, that's what it's supposed to do.

But without the focus on capturing any sort of period, Maverick has a lot more runtime to focus on other areas, and oh, does it use that time well. All Top Gun: Maverick centers around one mission, and builds up the tension and its characters to give the death-defying flying much more impact. This way of centering everything around a singular goal works well for Maverick, it gives everything a definitive reason for happening and gets the audience invested.(Something I feel the original lacked.). The plot is not perfect though, I feel that some characters were just forgotten about and their stories didn't end up going anywhere. However, the biggest flaw has to be the lackluster side-story.

The relationship between Maverick and Penny is a low part, while it's not inherently bad, it just lacks when compared to whats around it. I enjoyed what it did for Maverick's character, and how it gave the tone and pacing a break so that the audience wasn't overwhelmed with action and high stakes. But some of the scenes just feel like they could have just been cut from the movie without changing much, these scenes don't move any plot points forward or connect back to the theme in any meaningful way. So that just leaves these moments empty and lacking compared to the rest of the film.

Top Gun: Maverick has an air of quality and dedication to it. More So than anything it wants to celebrate the legacy of its predecessor, it doesn't get caught up in trying to replicate it, honor its fans of it with fake CGI recreation of past characters, or put too much emphasis on past ideas the original already explored. This is Top Gun put on another level, walking out of the theater I'm sure the emotions I felt were nearly identical to that of the audience of the OG back in the 80s. While I won't say Maverick feels ""21st century"" in the same way the original feels ""80's"", It has all the other things audiences love, now with the volume cranked up. Flying scenes are more energetic and dynamic, the plot tells an interesting story that is now better paced and written, and characters are more fleshed out without losing inherent appeal and instant likability. Most of the cast wasn't explored very much, but I still consider Maverick to have a superb cast, both because of the actors' top-notch performances, and the dialogue, which sets the tone and shows the characters' personalities perfectly.

I loved how Top Gun: Maverick made callbacks and handled the source material in its plot, instead of overt and cheesy callbacks that feel out of place, Maverick instead slips in little continuities with the original that only fans will notice. In particular, I have to commend the writers for plotting around Val Kilmer's (Iceman) condition respectfully and realistically.

Any complaints I can make amount more to missed potential than actual flaws which hamper the experience, Top Gun: Maverick is a movie that plays on its strengths and downplays its weaknesses to create a film that, while nowhere near perfect, will stick with audiences for years to come and change the perceived level of quality movies should have."
BEECHMAN123,"Jun 9, 2022",8,"Outstanding sequel
You must go and see this at the cinema!

Maverick ticked all the boxes, the cast and crew absolutely nailed it and it's probably the best sequel I've ever seen!

Tom knows his audience and doesn't disappoint! I liked how Maverick reminds the audience of the original, the wait and nostalgia are off the scale here.

From the moment the film starts until the closing credits you are taken on a fast paced journey that gives you a back seat swirling cockpit view which at times, had me clinging onto my seat! Some of the scenes and roar of the engines are worth the price of admission alone!

There maybe some who may say the plot or occasional dialogue are a little 'off the mark', personally, it's everything I wanted it to be, and more!

Maverick sets a very high standard here, and shows how a sequel should be done, taking the viewer to a place that lets us forget, for a couple of hours, all the mayhem in todays world.

Give yourself a break, an easy watch and a truly thrilling ride!"

I'll start off saying that I'm an older millennial who was not quite born yet when Top Gun came out. I've seen the original once years ago and then again recently to prepare watching the sequel. I'm not a huge fan but I liked it. I had so many emotions after watching the sequel, and my husband and I agreed this was one of the best cinematic experiences we've had. It had nostalgia without feeling corny, it had the romance without it being over the top and cliche, but the best was the visuals, the cinematography, the acting, those intense flying scenes. It was Top Gun on steroids. The casting was on point. I was going to give it 9/10 but it's perfection from beginning to end and actually lived up to the hype."
qwerty2145,"Jul 3, 2022",10,"A perfect, edge of the seat action film.
Is it the best film ever? Probably not but that is not why I scored this a 10. It is simply put an outstandingly excellent experience that needs to be seen the first time in the cinema.

For those 1 star reviews criticising the perceived pro USA stance and the like try and put that to one side. It is hardly the most bloodthirsty flag waving jingoistic film ever made. I have seen it twice now and have seen the original Top Gun several times. The performances and emotions displayed by Tom Cruise especially are subtle but importantly what I would expect a man to act like after several decades in the military. His performance underlined the emotions and losses that occur over time to those that serve. Still confident and determined but appreciative of the ""dying of the light"" that comes with age.

Even the hot shot younger pilots in this are not obnoxious and the direction I felt was excellent reflecting the carefree youthfulness whilst also considered in the possibility of such a fraught mission being their last.

I will own this on DVD when it gets there. Watch it, enjoy it and be glad it was delayed on its release as it was worth the wait."
MirkoS,"Jun 17, 2022",6,"I don't get it....
This movie has been met with near universal acclaim, and while enjoyable, I'm failing to see what makes this so special, much less better than the original.

Firstly (and this is more of a personal preference towards me being able to enjoy a film), plausibility. Something grounded in its fiction I find to be much more engrossing, relatable to the characters, plot, and overall more gratifying to the telling of its narrative than something that takes plot extravagances and liberties that, while fun in the spectacle and humorings they afford, renders the plot underpinning it so absurd and contrived that my suspension of disbelief falters.

The ending of this movie, for one example, was beyond stupid and implausible to the point of utter laughability.....hijacking an old F-14 with Goose's son from an enemy base and taking out two modern fighters on the way back to the carrier? Unlike the original, the plot was so contrived and artificial feeling I was left rolling my eyes the majority of the time, feeling the literal hands of the script writers intruding upon a narrative (one that should've been flowing naturally) to work to satiate that 30+ years of nostalgic buildup we've had. Which the film does, again, and again, and again. From the opening crawl and Kenny Loggins, to the bar scene and ""Great Balls of Fire"" (played by Goose's son, Rooster, no less), to hard deck scoldings, to homo-eroticism at the beach, to racing the plane on the bike, to even having Rooster saying ""Talk to me, Dad!"" before finding his courage to scream in and save the day. All the way to, yup, Maverick in a Tomcat again.

It was as if the filmmakers had a nostalgic bucket list to check off before even having a general narrative arc in mind, and this ""new"" plot was beholden to the past at all costs. This is what creative bankruptcy looks like, but apparently this is what audiences want, as people LOVE it and it's getting rave reviews everywhere I'm looking.

I for one crave some originality in my films."

The scenes are memorable and I had a smile on my face for the entirety of the movie. I suspect Tom cruise had a lot to do with its direction and writing as well, and he is terrific.

bankofmarquis,"Jun 1, 2022",7,"The Very Definition of ""Summer Flick""
There is absolutely no denying it - TOP GUN: MAVERICK is the very definition of a ""Summer Blockbuster"" movie - the kind of film that will appeal to a wide variety of audiences who want nothing more than to escape into a world of heroes (and villains), good vs. Evil, with lots of fast chases and things exploding.

And that is just what you get with the sequel to the 1986 hit - a summer blockbuster, which will do well at the box office - just don't expect tricky plot developments or in-depth character examinations. The plot and the characters are just there to deliver the blockbuster goods.

Bringing back the main character from the first TOP GUN film, Tom Cruise as Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, TOP GUN: MAVERICK shows Maverick 30 years (or so) after the events of the first film with ""just one more"" mission to go. Maverick is brought back to train a dozen hot-shot pilots, including one that is the son of his best friend - a friend who's death Maverick has been traumatized by during the past 30 years.

Cruise, of course, is perfect in this role. He has the right blend of arrogance and charisma to pull of the fine balance needed between these two traits. Jennifer Connelly is on board as the requisite love interest and she more than holds her own with Cruise in what is an underwritten role as are all of the roles in this film by writer Peter Craig (BAD BOYS FOR LIFE) with Direction by Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION).

Miles Teller (the son of the man who Maverick is mourning, who blames Maverick for his dad's death), John Hamm (the a-hole boss that thinks that Maverick is ""writing checks his body can't cash""), Glen Powell (the arrogant young hot shot) and the rest are all one-note caricatures that leaves the audience not really caring about their fate.

Only Val Kilmer (reprising his role as ""Iceman"" from the first movie) comes out of this unscathed for his character is suffering from throat cancer and cannot speak above a whisper (much like Kilmer in real life). It was good to see him on the big screen again.

But...you don't come to this film for the characters, you come to this picture for the high-flying action sequences, and...in the last part of this film...you get 'em in spades! Unfortunately, you get way too LITTLE action in the first part of this film, it's mostly nostalgic fond remembrances of the first film, so I found myself wriggling in my seat waiting for the action that I knew was to come.

It's the perfect summer movie and one that is far more superior being seen on the big screen. It is the type of flick that one doesn't have to pay to close attention to, but when it does grab your attention, it does it well...enough.

If you have the need...the need for speed...you can do much worse than TOP GUN: MAVERICK.

Letter Grade: B

kuner-59029,"Sep 7, 2022",6,"Enjoyable no brain feel good movie
Top Gun Maverick plays exacly like you expect it would. Tom Cruise plays the classic traumatized hero roll. He's still a pilot for some reason, still a thorn in the side of his superiors (even though it's never explained why), he gets to pass the baton to a new generation, and there's conflict with the son of Goose, who's death Tom Cruise has never gotten over.

There's a tame little romance in the film, there's a lot of team building stuff, there's the arrogant, highly competent guy who learns the value of teamwork, there's commanding officers threatening to shut the program down, there's some undefined threat by some undefined enemy (clearly Russia), which by the movie's logic justifies the US launching an unprovoked attack on a research and development facility which kills thousands. This may be my biggest gripe with the film. It basically says it's okay for the US to go around indiscriminately killing anyone who may be developing competitive military technology.

Questionable morals aside, the film captures much of the feel good vibe of the 80s original. It's an incredibly dumb film, but it's acted, edited, paced and scored well enough to remain entertaining throughout.

The aerial stunt and combat scenes are notable for using very little CGI, and they absolutely blow the cartoon physics trash from Marvel out of the water. I think all of this together explains the movie's success at the box office.

It reminded people of what a real blockbuster without woke identity politics and lsd trip style cgi action scenes feels like. It may not be a masterpiece, but you will be entertained and you won't feel insulted afterwards. The movie has no malice towards its audience."
leftbanker-1,"Aug 17, 2022",1,"Mav Proves that You're Never too Old to be a Frat Boy
Relentlessly corny and embarrassing at every step.

Mav comes back to fight the Antifa Air Force, but this time they have an ace up their sleeve: They have joined forces with the Black Lives Matter army, In the final dogfight, it's Maverick against Hillary Clinton. Who will prevail?

Isn't rooster just another word for chicken?

Almost every word of dialogue in this film was embarrassing to listen to. ""Talk to me, dad."" Wow, that was just horrible.

This is simply a torrent of smarmy, treacly cliches, mostly coming from the original.

The film is pretty awful in spite of all the voices in the media shouting about how it has saved the movie industry. If Top Gun is the solution, perhaps movies aren't worth saving.

We begin with nostalgia for the original, and much of this new film is just piling on debris on the ruins of the older version. Rooster holds a grudge against Maverick because of what happened to his father when he was like, three years old? And it was determined that Maverick wasn't at fault? Makes zero sense. Unless Mav was also some sort of pervy uncle.

Mav trashed an aircraft that is probably worth $35 million just because of his ""need for speed"" yet doesn't end up in jail for his stupidity.

Was the football orgy as homoerotic as the volleyball game in the original? Only you can decide that.

Evidently, Mav has a girlfriend. I would imagine that sex for him is just high-fiving and chest-bumping because his true love affair continues to be with Ice. Does his own mother call him Ice Man? I hope not."
jrlaamanen,"May 31, 2022",10,"Second Best Sequel EVER made
I truly believe Terminator 2: Judgment Day to be the greatest sequel ever made.

However this came damn close. Nothing is ever at this level.

Everything about this movie was absolutely perfect. I as a fan of the first movie as well as Tom's work was blown away. Anyone who's followed the movie scene in the last few years have seen the reboots and so called sequels Hollywood has pumped out to try to cash on the Nostalgia. Some of the efforts are better than others, but most left a bad taste in your mouth and even tainted the first film's legacy.

The technical aspects were amazing, excellent editing, incredible stunts, endless practical effects which is the way it should ALWAYS be done but unfortunately hasn't been for some time, and never on this level.

Tom Cruise brings another killer performance as you'd expect, but everyone is on their A-Game.

This movie is faithful to it's original as a sequel, I loved the plot points that were brought into the new film, as well as continuing on with Iceman and Goose's legacies. Rooster is a spitting image of his old man, and the way the story handled it was perfect. Just like the original movie, there was incredibly emotional scenes that you felt as if you were there. Many films cannot capture this lightning in a bottle and often come off arrogant or downright stupid.

Growing up, I've always seen the greatest action movies (in my opinion) many times. But these were years and decades later enjoyed on VHS or DVD in my living room. I am truly glad to have been able to go see this the way it was intended, on the big screen. As of writing this, I have seen the film 3 times, in a regular theatre with Dolby Atmos, Ultra AVX, Ultra AVX D-Box. It was still just as awesome the third time. I am planning to see it again when it comes to IMAX in my area.

If you're thinking about checking it out please do. But if you have just heard of it and haven't seen the original yet, make sure you catch up on it first as it contains a lot of things you'll need to know."

Miller teller shines as goose son, really, he is in the same acting range of tom cruise in this movie.

Not only both tom and miles share scenes, also both bring the dramatic and emotional scenes to the movie.

Glen powell does a fun version of him, and jennifer connely is the girl that keeps the drama on earth.

The original Top-Gun was mostly realistic. But this is a Joke.

Unless the Enemy was Canada, the operation is absurd.

Let's suppose the enemy is current Russia: 1. The max-speed of a Hornet is 0.53km/s, so the hornet must travel between 90 and 200km before reaching the bunker. The detection range of the Russian Anti-air S-400 system is 400 km, and can track low-altitude targets at extremely long range (below the radio horizon).

2. A Su-57 (5-Generation aircraft) has R-37 missiles (hypersonic air-to-air missile), the R-37 uses a Doppler radar, so flares won't be as useful as against infrared missiles.

3. And the Carrier Group would be sunk with 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missiles even before the Hornets reach the destination. I said Carrier Group, a Carrier is always part of a Carrier Strike Group, composed of at list 4 major ships, plus logistic and supply ships, etc, roughly 7,500 personnel 4. Even the airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system would be shot down in a real scenario.

I am, unlike the others in this review section, very young, and remember seeing the first movie just a couple of years ago when my mother urged me to, stating it's a classic you simply can't miss. I honestly enjoyed the original, and for me it's the perfect «old school» action movie, that you can put on to pop out of our high-tech low-social soeciety for a while (please excuse my wording if it's regarded offensive in any way). The story and action were truly amazing.

However, Top Gun: Maverick was the sequal we never knew we needed. It fullfills the story to a tee, and is the perfect ending to a legendary story. I can honestly, wholeheartedly say this is the best movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot. The story, the action mixed with nostalgy and reminiscence is balanced perfectly, and is a true masterpiece. After I saw the movie the first time, I immidietly googled it, and learning the efforts and love Cruise put into the movie just made me love it, if possible, even more.

A fun movie with some, like the original, great flying scenes. Tom Cruise was excellent returning to the role that really make him a superstar and the supporting cast is great. The story worked with a an older, somewhat wiser Maverick getting sent back to Top Gun school to train others to take out an UNKNOWN ENEMY'S (but we know it's Russia) Uranium cracking plant. This avoids some of the silly plot tropes usually in these movies, but the ending, when Maverick and Rooster are shot down, walk onto an enemy base and steal an old F-14, is just silly. He also shoots down two fifth generation enemy fighters in this old, retired plane. Why did the enemy have one? Because: Plot. But it was fun.

2. Goose's son Rooster might as well have been played by a no name actor (Rather than Miles Teller... who I think is awesome) since the character's entire identity consists of being Goose's son and being slighted by Maverick in the past.

3. Along the same line... no character other than Maverick has any depth whatsoever.

4. Tons of lazy info dumping inserted into dialog to explain Maverick's past 30 years.

5. Hangman is just a douchier and less interesting Iceman.

6. Love story with Jennifer Connelly was kind of pointless.

7. Dialog was cheesy throughout a lot of the movie and they went a little too heavy on the nostalgia IMO.

8. The mission the movie centers around is kind of ridiculous. They basically were like ""let's have Maverick and Rooster do the Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star thing."" I mean Rooster even had to basically use the force to hit the target in the end. And I'm not a military tactician, but why wouldn't they have used a stealth bomber with precision guided bunker busting bombs or any other option rather than what they chose? It just doesn't make sense to me. Is it really so difficult to invent a believable mission that would require skilled fighter pilots these days?

With all of that said.... I thought it was fun to watch for the most part. The action sequences were enjoyable. Pretty much every moment involving a jet was exciting. Seeing Val Kilmer do his thing was nice.

I enjoy it well enough.... I wanted to love it."
anou-20865,"Dec 31, 2022",1,"Boring and so much predictable
If you like planes you will like to see this movie. If you like suspense, you will be very bored by the same movie.

Nothing new on planet Hollywood there. Just planes and typical Tom Cruise. Flip and flop the plane, very long scenes of characters talking to each other saying nothing and you can predict everything from the 1st second to the last.

I must say image is nice and landscapes are beautiful seen from the sky but this doesn't make you a story, a plot or any kind of intrigue.

And what about feelings and tears? Empty.

Have a nice day and watch another movie. This one is not worth 8+ stars. Unbelievable."

I don't think you are able to appreciate all the subtleties of this film until you watch it at least 3 times and in different formats (4DX, IMAX, etc.)

This movie is an instant classic. I am leaving the theater with my neck in pain (again), they took the air scenes to a complete new level.

There is a well-built story, likeable characters, constant references to the 80s flick, hey, we even discover that Tom Cruise can act...

Takes a classically great story and flies off the charts with how good the next chapter is. Movie theaters were made for movies like this.

This movie is the best movie I've ever seen in this genre. It deserves to get 10 but I gave it a 9 because of 2 reasons:

1- When enemy saw Maverick tried to shoot him but in real world nobody does that. The guy is like a pure gold, they capture him and get all the information they need.

2- The make up on Iceman guy was terrible. Is your makeup artist a little kid???????

Better than the original, because it had to be. Everything about this movie is a 10! It left me feeling emotional and melancholy for the life I was leading in 1986, it was a different world that saw the original as a fun, adrenaline rush like none we had seen. The harshness of the world meant this movie was going to be darker. And it is. However. It was a far superior movie to the first Tom has aged with grace and has an attention to detail that I appreciate as a movie goer. Yes, there are references to the first movie, but because it needed to show that while everything changes, nothing really changes at all. No spoilers here. Just a huge TC fan who has seen it twice on opening weekend and will go for a third before it leaves the theaters.

The film is exciting and nostalgic. Watching the film amazed me with how the score was composed, acting and visuals were accomplished. I like the drama between Maverick and Rooster, showing the two never let go of the past but eventually accept what has happened had happened. The scene between maverick and Iceman was great and sad to see. The scenes in the F-18's are above satisfying to watch and I loved the enemy dogfight sequence where the SU57 misses the missile and surprises Maverick, showing the enemy is more than a challenge to compete against where Maverick risks to even the odds. The ending of this film is one of the most unique conclusions to any film I will ever see in my lifetime. To all the crew and cast of the film well done to what you've accomplished, bringing an amazing sequel packed with action, drama and nostalgia along with a gripping story that demands for attention."

Tom Cruise is just a master at making movies people love to watch and this is one of his best.

The biggest negative of streaming platforms is quantity over quality and the lack of big blockbuster movies made for the big screen.

This movie is so refreshing and is one of the best movies released in a long time. It's hard to think of any negatives or how it could be improved.

It was a huge risk making this sequel so long after the iconic first film, but I think it even surpasses the original, which is an incredible feat."

This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience."

Just the low realism, the complete disregard for physics. But nobody watching this cares for that anyway.

The you have extremely lame, ultra high EQ military, never happen and never will. The first movie showed that much better and much more realistically.

The flight scenes, which made the first movie a success are not that much better, and obviously lacking originality.

Third, invading Iran with kids in training school, must be a joke. Oh, and with ancient planes.

Sorry, but it's just a pile of nonsense, and even more sadly, what keeps people interested is reminiscing about the first movie. It's sad to watch."
tareque2742,"Aug 16, 2022",1,"They show something in movie which is impossible
A real world engagement between the F-14 and Su-57 would likely end very differently to that in Top Gun: Maverick, and would almost certainly take place at beyond visual ranges. While the F-14 boasts a larger main radar, it is mechanically rather than electronically scanned and several decades out of date while the Su-57 deploys not one, but six, electronically scanned array radars as well as an infra red search and track system. The immense technological gap between the fighters, and the Su-57's advanced Himalalyas electronic warfare system and AESA radars, would likely leave the F-14 blinded and thus more vulnerable to being targeted at range. The Su-57 could also use its stealth capabilities, combined with its ability to operate without a radar signature using its infrared sensor, to neutralise Tomcats at medium ranges without allowing the adversary to gain a radar lock. The next generation fighter would have even more overwhelming advantages within visual ranges, since the F-14 does not integrate helmet mounted sights or high off boresight capable missiles meaning the Su-57 could engage it at very extreme angles. It would be further aided by its extreme manoeuvrability, considered the best in the world at low speeds, while the F-14 was considered unmaneouvrable even by the standards of its generation."

Feel good vibes in abundance, excellent casting, it never feels too long or too short. Simply one of the best ""simple"" movies Hollywood has put out in many, many years - if you want to be thoroughly entertained from start to finish and not preached to, this is the movie for you.

adcadams,"Jun 4, 2022",10,"Thanks - from my 1986 and 2022 selves
To me, the amount of effort, intelligence, and heart put into the making of this movie was evident from the beginning to the end. As one of those who stood in line to watch Top Gun when it came out back in 1986, the stakes were clearly high. So many sequels are made that do not quite capture the magic of the first one so, although I was excited to see this trailer, I will admit I did brace myself for disappointment. I have never been more pleased to stand corrected. Easter eggs all over the place. Appropriate homage made to the original, with improvements to really showcase actual flying. I can only begin to imagine the amount of preparation and creative out of the box thinking it took to accomplish this. Watching this with knowlege that there was limited CGI kept me awestruck, engaged, and impressed the entire time. Story line was great - some things predictable but in a good way as it was the only smart way to move the story forward appropriately to make sense. I highly suggest watching the first Top Gun again closely before seeing this to refamiliarize or familiarize yourself with details and story line, give yourself the chance to catch on to those easter eggs, and allow yourselves to join us in what we have known for over 30 years - Top Gun is iconic for a reason and this sequel story needed to be told. All of this together made for a wonderful movie experience - I saw and appreciated all of it. Was it worth the wait? Goodness, Gracious Great Balls of Fire, Hell Yes."
joe-28176,"Jun 29, 2022",10,"Finally, thank you! This is why movies are made: love for going to the theatre restored.
Top Gun: Maverick has restored my faith in film! This is why cinephiles and movie lovers go to the theatre in the first place.

This movie has heart, adrenaline, great acting, REAL stunts (just incredibly produced) and a sense of nostalgia so thick that you can't help but smile and feel emotional throughout the entire runtime. WOW, was this a fun experience. I haven't felt this way watching a movie in the theatre in a long, long time. People in the audience were genuinely cheering, laughing, clapping and standing up at the end. The pre-movie speech from Tom Cruise totally pays off: ""we made this for you"", absolutely you did.

This movie comes at a time of serious decline in the filmmaking industry. It is a breathe of hot, fast, fresh air away from the current structure of pushing as much CGI/green screen on the audience whilst being accompanied with lacklustre plots, weak scripts and no character development. If Hollywood experiences box office success from terribly made cash grabs such as Jurassic World Dominion and the recent array of poorly made comic book movies... then they will be the films that will be shown in our theatres. We need more movies like Top Gun: Maverick... you know, the type of movies that have simple but well articulated plot lines; character and story development; emotion; heart; adrenaline; epic music; unreal cinematography; insane stunts; and yes... a nostalgic experience that not only pushes the envelope, but proceeds to surpass the original classic.

I created an IMDB account for this to be my first review. For me, this is up there with recent classics like Blade Runner: 2049, Inception, The Lord of The Rings and other epics that do not fail to deliver. This will be considered a classic in due time and is incredibly rewatchable.

Thank you to the team for this project after countless disappointments in the theatre lately. This is the 2022 Summer blockbuster that fans of the original, and fans of great movies needed. I am still smiling and listening to the soundtrack after that experience. Do not miss the chance to see this one of the big screen!!! Highway to the Danger Zone, Don't Think Just Do, I have the need...the need for speed and EPIC movies once again. 10/10."

yellowgixxer750,"Oct 5, 2022",10,"Good enough to suspend disbelief...mostly
I'm biased as I was involved in the production of the first Top Gun as a pilot on exchange at Miramar at the time. But I'd waited for this and had high hopes that, if nothing else, it would be entertaining. It's Tom Cruise after all, and he rarely disappoints on that front.

So. There's a plot. It's a little bit cliched, but there's only so many new things they can come up with. There's the disgruntled offspring of the dead best friend. There's the grudging admiration of an old rival. There's the reluctant affection of an old flame. There's the bolshy kid with an attitude. All pretty standard.

Then there's the flying. Not standard. Not at all. Top Gun was beautifully formed. Maverick takes it up several notches and does it brilliantly. Without CGI. And it shows.

The script is well done, the dialogue is witty in places and cheesy in others. The acting is excellent.

And here's a thing. In the cold light of day my experience tells me that a major part of the main mission planning is nonsense. I'll not go into details because I don't want to put a spoiler. But sat there in the cinema, engrossed in the film, I didn't care. Disbelief was sufficiently suspended so that, even when I knew something wasn't right, I didn't care.

That, ladies and gentlemen, is the mark of a great film."

grantss,"Jun 19, 2022",7,"Highly entertaining
After over thirty years in the US Navy, Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is still flying. He should be an Admiral by now but that's not how things have worked out. When a country antagonistic towards the US builds a uranium enrichment site with the aim of creating nuclear weapons, the Navy devises a plan to bomb and destroy the site. They call Maverick back to Top Gun to train the pilots for the mission. One of the pilots is Lt Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw, the son of Maverick's former Radar Intercept Office, Goose, who died while flying with Maverick. Rooster still bears a grudge against Maverick.

An action-packed sequel to Top Gun (1986). The plot is quite cheesy, contrived and unrealistic and also quite predictable in many ways but the action more than makes up for this. Some incredible flying sequences, all done using actual aircraft rather than CGI.

Tom Cruise does what he does best, be an all-action hero, and does it very well. Of the original cast, only he and Val Kilmer are in this one and Kilmer only has one scene. Jennifer Connelly fills in for Kelly McGillis as the love interest (one of the more predictable sub-plots within the film). A host of young stars, lead by Miles Teller as Rooster, put in decent performances as the new breed of Top Gun pilots.

All in all, it's basic and predictable but highly entertaining."

awesome-30820,"Aug 28, 2022",9,"The Sequel We Didn't Know We Needed
Sequels are a slippery slope to potentially hindering original movies, however Top Gun: Maverick succeeds where most sequels fail.

The movie emphasizes on the relationship between Lt. Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell and Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Goose's son). In most 80s action movies, the audience never gets to fully understand how certain deaths of side characters affected the future of main protagonist. The choice for this emphasis in the sequel makes you truly care for Goose's character. The audience can feel even after 30 years how Maverick has been burdened by the death of his best friend. This movie however emphasizes on the idea of forgiveness. By getting Bradley's forgiveness after a series of events, Maverick was truly free from the weight he has been having to carry along with him in a very heart warming way.

The film's tone is very tense when it needs to be. In high-stakes situations there is a good constant tension and a sense danger, but the directors do a magnificent job at not making this 'tension' exhausting for the audience. It was very suspenseful, and just when you thought it couldn't get better, it does.

In terms of stylistic features, and other artistic choices, Top Gun Maverick is a clear example on why film can be such a breath-taking experience. From the high speed chases, to low-altitude flying environments, the movie is incredibly beautiful and very cinematic (I really want to point out a specific shot of Rooster thinking about returning to enemy lines to save Maverick). The choice for so much practical effects shot in real planes should definitely give the film the credit it deserves.

Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick did an impeccable job at continuing the story from the original, despite it being totally unnecessary plot-wise (which is a magnificent accomplishment on its own). Bringing back key characters was the icing on the cake for most fans and the frame that dedicates the film to Tony Scott was heart warming.

Three words to describe what the film develops on is limits, instinct, and forgiveness."
cuzicantstop,"Feb 17, 2024",10,"Just the right balance of nostalgia and new
I finally got a chance to watch this movie, and I'm so glad I did.

I loved Top Gun growing up, and this sequel was one of the rare good ones. Usually, studios try to hold on to the past so hard that it stunts the movie, or they try to rush too far forward and pump out a corny film.

The balance is perfect in this. There's just enough nostalgia, but it moves forward perfectly with new material.

Tom Cruise is also an absolute bad-ass. I don't know how the guy keeps doing it, but in my opinion, this is one of his best all time movies.

MxParker-OBE,"Mar 8, 2023",5,"Overhyped & Unoriginal
When it's not following the outline of the original, TPM fills in with familiar and predictable tropes. Students go to Top Gun, Hotshot Ego Kid clashes with the others, everyone has something to prove, Tom Cruise has some kind of love affair, motorcycle riding, ""the impossible mission,"" dog fighting, the mission, and (of course) Maverick is the best. The appearance of Val Kilmer is touching and he acts circles around Tom Cruise for his brief appearance (especially since he can no longer really speak), but the rest of the film is entirely forgettable.

A good sequel should stand on its own, but without detailed knowledge of the original Top Gun, Maverick completely falls apart. Rooster's entire character is basically a walking reminder of Goose and he is only relevant because of how Mav feels about Goose all these years later.

Outside of a good cameo, Iceman functions as a kind of Deus Ex Machina/Fairy Godmother/ Magic Shield for Mav, blocking any consequences from the number of illegal or unethical decisions Mav can't stop himself from making. In addition to everything that should have gotten Mav kicked out of the military in the original Top Gun (which was somehow pardoned with Iceman's influence) and everything since then he's done to get kicked out (also pardoned with Iceman's influence), Mav can't stop being reckless, disobeying orders, talking back to superior officers, breaking laws, and racking up a whole new list of ways to get kicked out. But the viewers know that Mav and his career will be fine - because he's the hero. There's no passing of the baton, no lesson learned, no development, no stakes, nothing we haven't seen before or couldn't see done better somewhere else."

New characters are great and it is a very classical ""feel-good"" film that leaves you wanting to see it again. I am sure over time this will become a classic just like the first one. Hopefully they make another one, or a few others, but even if this were the last, great way to leave the story. Loved it."

Possible one of the greatest films I've ever watched. Everything about this film is perfect! Sequels are usually not that good but this...this is bang on!"
ccrisss,"Aug 28, 2022",7,"Don't think, just watch it
It's not meant to be complex and deep. Watch it for what it is, a 2-hour escape from reality and enjoy the ride.

Was it a bit predictable? Yes. Could they have done without the love interest? Damn right.

But, all things considered, I guess the ratings are really high not because it's a perfect movie, but because of how this movie makes people feel. I personally felt nostalgic and just plain happy watching Tom Cruise do his thing.

Apart from the stunning visual & the thrill of the mission, this sequel (which is better than the original) just ticks all the right boxes. Great cast, awesome music. Just enjoy it."
leedan91,"May 30, 2022",10,"The true classic Hollywood summertime movie is back!
Tom Cruise just re-asserted himself as the top global superstar of blockbuster movies! This was an awesome movie and you could argue better than the original, which is a tall order.

The plot paid homage to old characters of the past in a touching way. The action scenes were awesome. This is a movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. We watched it in IMAX and it was great.

10/10. Thank you Tom Cruise for bringing summer back to the world!"
sherlockshen,"Sep 27, 2022",7,"Still the same recipe
I never watched Top Gun 1 before, mainly because I'm afraid that I can't enjoy the old quality of an old movie. I guess that doesn't matter at all after I watched Maverick.

The storyline is so familiar to me, not because I'm familiar with the series. This is just the same with most Hollywood movie storylines.

This time, the only difference is that the enemy doesn't have an exact country name.

Besides these, my overall review of this movie is positive. It's my very first time watching a pilot theme movie. Kind of novel for me. And also, I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise. I have a clear understanding that his movie can't be touching in terms of story."
mhamidi,"Jan 11, 2023",4,"Formulaic.
I don't write reviews much, but I don't understand why this movie got such a high rating. It's predictable and Tom Cruise is pretty much the same character in all his movies. The whole premise with Goose's son going from angry at old guy to understanding him has been done in so many other movies. The beach scene is useless except to show everyone's muscles. The ""admirals"" are generic bureaucrats that could've been played by anyone. The ending action scene was not surprising in the least. Sure some of the flying moves were great, but how many times do we need to see Tom Cruise fly upside down? I get the nostalgia, but man, besides liking the fact that they gave Val Kilmer a scene, it was really disappointing."
woobs-93616,"Jun 8, 2022",10,"No BS, just straight action, heart and acting
Just got back from my second viewing. Fantastic movie. I haven't felt this satisfied coming out of a movie in a while. It still baffles me how they filmed this.

The action isn't the only great thing about this movie. It actually makes you care about the characters.

This is what happens when the creators care about a movie!"
jaredrammage,"May 29, 2022",10,"Wow.. Such a phenomenal movie
I have no words. This movie feels perfect in every way. I honestly wouldn't change a single thing about it. I was speechless after the movie, only able to just keep saying how good the movie was.

I have three different groups of people that I told about the movie and they want to go see it. I will go see it with them, each one of them, and cherish the movie over and over again.

Well done on this cinematic masterpiece. Next up, IMAX experience."
zkzedydl,"Aug 27, 2022",10,"Just when you have given up hope...
I thought I wouldn't see such a movie coming out of Hollywood ever again, just when I thought I have given up hope, this movie is the saving grace of most things coming out of Hollywood. This film touches, it inspires, it motivates, it unites and not divide people. No political nonsense, no pretense of any kind, just pure perfection of the every element that makes a movie great.

It has the love, character, integrity, sacrifice, humility we all need in our lives in these trying times. I was struggling to hold back shedding tears while watching it. I wished it never ended. Tom is one of the actors I wished lived forever."
leewolfadams,"Sep 23, 2022",10,"Simply enjoyable
I regret not seeing this in cinema. I thought it was just overhyped and probably wouldn't be that be but it was just sooo simply enjoyable. Every movie has ""clichés"" but not every movie can pull them off and dam this movie does it so well I don't even realise.

I was never a Huge fan of the original although it is good so I wasn't invested in it so much as a sequel compared to others and yet they still manage to give you that nostalgia with time cruise in blue Jeans white top with some classic vehicles and great camera work.

I won't spoil the story but it sets itself up real nice so it doesn't feel too forced and whilst being a relatively simply story it doesn't come off that way.

Just get some snacks and put your feet up."
zwanzigz,"Jul 6, 2022",10,"Best movie in 3 years
Wow. Just wow. I went into this thinking it would disappoint like so many Sequels do....... Was I wrong. Perfect mix of old movie and new plot. I never hand out 10 ratings but there wasn't one complaint."
talalaldokhayel,"Jun 10, 2022",10,"THE BEST SEQUEL SINCE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK!!
Every single part of this movie was perfect acting scenery sound effects music and so so so much more it respects the original and doesn't just use it for the cheap nostalgia like so many sequels of older movies."
thurstanjohnston,"Nov 12, 2022",6,"A good film in its own right
This film is so much of a copy of the original, but without the cool factor of the original. That one you walk away humming the theme tune or danger zone, this one?

The action is really good, exhilarating and thrilling. The story again is very much copying the original, thus cliched. None of the actors are very likeable, there is no chemistry between them.in all I think this was a sequel that didn't need making and if it did 30 years is far too long I to wait.

Oh and the actors did NOT fly the jets as many seem to think. Though they were in them.

Definitely a film to see in the theatre/cinema to appreciate it more."
domad22,"Jun 3, 2022",10,"Maverick, Iceman ....Top Gun is a great Epic
I love it so much, after 36 years I still love the both of them.

Maverick is the one who has believed in his abilities and skills without any limitations Iceman with very short story but I felt the deep friendship between them."
kiwitom-58176,"Aug 26, 2022",3,"Pretty bad really..
Just bad overall- every scene overblown and clichéd. Yes there's a nostalgic angle but its just a barrage of improbability and scmaltz. Disappointing."
Kalamoren,"Aug 24, 2022",9,"Top Gun meets Mission Impossible meets Star Wars
Top Gun Maverick is a wash rinse repeat formula right from the opening title, so much in fact that I had to double check I was watching the right film and not the first one again.

The yet another love story was less intrusive and more appreciable, especially with the sublime Jennifer Connelly and while Val Kilmer is back don't hold your breath.

Tom Cruise is off to Top Gun again, but to teach recruits a Mission Impossible previously seen in Star Wars IV: A New Hope where the Rebels had to follow a perilous path in their one shot to blow up the Death Star.

I'll spare the details but eventually they get a mission accomplished. And while I was satisfied with this sequel and denouement, I wanted more before the credits starts to roll, and oh boy did I get more. And after I could I could take no more. I still GOT MORE. I was in awe, at the edge of my seat, speechless and mindblowned.

The IMAX 4k + insane manoeuvres, flights and stunts were incredible. That one scene where one enemy pilot avoid a missile by doing a spiralling-dead-butterfly-I-don't-know-what manoeuvre will stay with me for a long time and I almost started rooting for him afterwards.

Yes Top Gun Maverick is a little on the nose and predictable but I had a blast watching it. I was originally gonna rate it a 8 but I'm bumping it to 9 out of 10."
sushantsharma-89909,"Jul 29, 2022",8,"Solid Content
What a wonderful movie with solid Content and awesome cinematography. Realistic visuals and effects. And most important Tom cruise action scenes.

I wanted to give 10/10 but unusual love story and slow beginning pulled me to 8."
wildernessranger,"Aug 25, 2022",10,"Finally, a good non-woke movie
So, you want to know how to make a great movie with thrilling action, a good story, and a diverse cast without shoving it down your throat sideways? Here it is. Rewatch the original Top Gun first if it's been a while, then sit back and enjoy a well paced, emotional ride."
ghistes,"Jun 19, 2022",10,"Together with T2 the best sequel ever!
And at the same time the best Tom Cruise movie so far. I do not really care what he believes in in his private time. He is the cinema God and we should all believe in him! He proves time after time the passion for true action cinema and reality of stunts and this movie tops all before it by a mile. Must see. Thank you Tom, you are one of the all time Greats."
js_senior,"Jun 8, 2022",10,"Wow, what a brilliant nostalgic movie!
Just got out the cinema, watched it in 4DX. Best movie I've seen in a long time and as a massive fan of the original I am glad this sequel surpassed my expectations. I just wish it hadn't been so long to see it. Haha. Gave me goosebumps throughout, a few teary moments and plenty of laughs. Great action and story. I'm now going to grow a goose/rooster tash!"
ilkerdenizunal,"Jun 23, 2022",10,"Its been a while that an actor could both show love scenes and action in a great way
Joseph Kosinski did a great job film does have some love/kissing scenes but its mixed in a excellent way that u dont get bored from it or it doesnt take away action scenes flying scenes are also excellent. Tom Cruise might be 60 years old but hes still handsome and a great actor both Miles and Tom Cruise were awesome."
alex-322029310,"Oct 17, 2022",6,"A truly sad example of the state of today's blockbuster cinema
First, the good things:

The runtime is not overly long, compared to the numerous other movies that try to compensate their poor script with a 3 hours runtime.

Tom Cruise is great, although lacking chemistry with any of the other co-stars. Never thought I'd give him credit, as I didn't like him as an actor in earlier days; but since Edge of Tomorrow my respect for him grows, due to him being an actor that just delivers regardless of the material he's supposed to work with.

The visuals of the dogfights are - expectedly - looking great.

And that's it. The story is an absolute bore - just as an example, in the first minutes my girlfriend predicted everything happening (e.g. In the hangar ""now he will surely ride on his bike). It delivers all the cheesy tropes of its predecessor and at times feels like it's been a remake and not a sequel.

The chemistry of the actors - all the drama is just filler material between the dogfights, and it exactly feels that way.

The realism of the main plot is completely absent. From the overall scenario over mission details, to the looks of the SAM batteries which look like how a kid would draw them (on mountain ridges without any nearby radar systems), it's just bad.

I won't criticize it as a negative that at times it feels like a promotional movie for the Navy, only because it's exactly following the footsteps of the original flick here.

It's sad considering how much budget and hype went into this movie, which, as others put it perfectly, doesn't provide anything memorable a few days after watching it. It's just a complete recycle of the concept of the first movie, with decent visuals and an OK pacing, but the rest is completely unmemorable. Probably the fun is also ruined through the movie taking itself somewhat serious, in contrast to blockbusters like Pacific Rim that deliver exactly the ridiculousness that you would expect from their setup, and are perfect popcorn cinema, with visual grandeur on top.

Top Gun Maverick is a bloodless rip-off, which just exists because of it's IMAX visuals, its established name, and the studio's need for moneyprinting. In the end, a real IMAX documentary about fighter pilots, with some Hans Zimmer background music, would have had the same or even better entertainment value."
thomjongenelis,"Jul 1, 2022",10,"Back in time, and not, but wow
Epic movie. I just liced the original Top Gun, know every line of text by heart. Saw it over and over again I am amazed and thrilled by this sequal. It has the right mix of better action, emotions, and heritage. It is magnificant.

I had trouble watching the screen because of the constant flow of tears in my eye."
brewster-50284,"Jul 5, 2022",7,"Great flying sequences but not a great storyline
For me, there are too many repeats of scenes from the original movie... the vast scene where Rooster plays the piano, the beach volleyball scene and the opening sequences backed by the Danger Zone track. But it's enjoyable trip to the movies. Not Tom Cruises worst movie but definitely not his best."
simmoh-72682,"Jul 20, 2022",5,"Seriously?
This movie set a new record for the number of times I said, ""You've got to be kidding me."" We do have a military, they do have airplanes, and there are threats to our national security out there that said military must sometimes combat. But those are about the only factual aspects of this movie. The basic underlying premise of the story was actually fairly good, It was even grounded in actual reality, though it did seem to intermix real world threats from two very different countries. But the detail and execution of the story were mostly ridiculous, and at times became completely absurd. Even most of the characters were over the top ridiculous. On the bright side, the action sequences and cinematography were absolutely spectacular, which is really what saved the movie from being a complete flop in my eyes. If you're one of those folks naive enough to believe Iron Eagle had any semblance to reality whatsoever, you'll love this movie. If action sequences are everything to you, to the exclusion of mostly everything else, you'll love this movie. But if you, like me, are sick of having Hollywood pushing completely ridiculous plots and characters, you'll be disappointed (again)."
