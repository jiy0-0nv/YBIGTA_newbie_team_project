8,Miyod,"Jun 7, 2025","the sequel is better than the original, the main character has become smarter, it was nice to see his rival from the first part, and the young actors did a good job."

10,Akoltuniuk,"Apr 28, 2025",The 10/10 review holds strong. I was excited to see how this was upon rewatch and I was not disappointed in the slightest.
10,Movieliefhebber,"Jan 6, 2025",top gun 2 was a masterpiece really a beautiful film worthy of an oscar this film one of the very best films ever made i think this film is pure class
10,Doomsdaylama,"Oct 25, 2024","The best movie ever, I loved the sound design and overall the cinematography"
10,Moviefan98,"Oct 13, 2024",Top Gun: Maverick is one I am completely lost for words to describe the Maverick experience as it was just magnificent as I was blown away from it.
7,drqshadow,"Oct 2, 2024","Given the influence of rose-tinted nostalgia and the remarkable staying power of the original, Tom Cruise and company could be forgiven for just running everything back and cashing it in for the Top Gun sequel. And, as far as the plot is concerned, that’s pretty much what they’ve done. Sure, we’ll see a few mild distinctions, plus a shift in perspective (Cruise certainly isn’t going to play a student pilot, nor is he apt to give up that top billing), but the bones are essentially the same. Cocky kids in an elite dogfight academy are ordered to set aside their differences and accomplish an impossible mission in hostile airspace. Adrenaline, testosterone and pheromones run wild. We even get a reprisal of the YouTube-famous beach volleyball scene. It’s a fitting tribute and a worthy successor, modernized to suit today’s high-end home theater equipment, but not half as gloriously ‘80s-tastic as the first film.

Where Maverick really soars (if you’ll pardon the awful pun) is in a technical sense. This was evidently an area of special concern for the filmmakers, and they deserve special credit for the accomplishment. All that work to embed an array of super-resolution cameras into the pilot’s seat has paid off: this is a major level-up moment, on par with the very best IMAX showpieces. Paired with a persistent soundtrack of strained grunts and rapid breathing, the footage does a fantastic job of conveying the intense physical effort that’s required to maintain control of a fighter jet, while also portraying the stunning vistas and dizzying speeds of afterburner combat. More than just special effects for a film, Maverick’s vision of airborne cinema borders on a true life experience. As a film, it’s a light-hearted flex of the bicep, designed to pluck memory threads and evoke warm feelings established by the original. Worthwhile, especially for long-term fans, but not particularly special. The cockpit scenes, though, especially that blood-rushing one-cut takeoff from the aircraft carrier, will stick with me for a long while."

9,Mrington,"May 30, 2024","A complete masterpiece if you like action movies, the fact that the second is better than the first one is a rare thing,"
10,przybylop,"May 29, 2024","This is one of the rare perfect movies I've seen. It's not overwhelmingly profound or epic, but every line of dialogue, every casting choice, and every shot serves their purpose perfectly. No wasted movements or scenes. It can be used to teach ""How to build a satisfying blockbuster"" class for years to come. It goes big, it gets weighty enough with existential issues, and it has enough twist and turns to make you question if the aging protagonist is supposed to survive this. 

Cruise is at his best as the equal parts vulnerable and cocky Maverick. His instant chemistry with Connelly makes you believe the latter was really in the original/first Top Gun. Supporting roles are hit with expert precision.

Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. It reaches all of its goals (action, star-driven, thoughtful, nostalgic, fun, suspense) effortlessly."
9,raymond0229,"May 29, 2024","An epic movie, no need to explain anything, period!!!! Great acting, production and effects. Can't wait to see what's next."
9,Samuelsonuel,"May 26, 2024","Great movie, about pilots. It is really close between this one and the original but I would say the original one clears by the length of Kenny Pickett’s hand."
0,WokeNonsense,"Apr 27, 2024","Woke nonsense. The nominal villains -- the enemy fighter pilots -- are barely represented on the screen. The actual villains are all white, male Armed Forces higher-ups: the Vice Admiral (Jon Hamm), the Admiral (Ed Harris), etc. This movie hates the US military."
10,Borutogabi,"Apr 27, 2024","Um filme maravilhoso, ótima experiência, sabe criar momentos de ação e deixar você maluco querendo saber o que vai acontecer UMA OBRA PRIMA"
10,CoolSun,"Dec 26, 2023","Perfect.  Holistically sound on all gears.  Tom Cruise Brilliant!  Producer, co-director, and actor.  Perfect timing."
8,valeriiege,"Oct 30, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick is surely better than its successor. Prequels after long years are dangerous because most of them are forcibly pushed stories. But Maverick, connects all the dots successfully and offers great action. And, of course, nostalgia always wins."
10,tactanon,"Sep 14, 2023","Disney and hollywood needs to take some notes. Reviving/continuing old movies means you need to reference and nod to the classics before it, which TG:Mav did and continued to extend the story. The story was smart not to mix politics (didn't mention where the enemies are from). That's why the film did extremely well and got paid billions. Pay the fan's service, and they'll pay you in box office sales. Simple math."
7,o_rety,"Aug 27, 2023","Stealing a line from another reviewer: I liked the parts with airplanes :). Don't get me wrong, the rest was not particularly bad. But, the emotional parts were overly melodramatic (and made it look padded with too much filler), and you better don't engage your rational qualities at some plot points (especially during the last segment) - you won't see much sense there. This movie was totally in tune with it's hero - a dying breed. A proper blockbuster focusing on delivering fun and action."
10,XMarkX,"Aug 20, 2023",Tom Cruise is very dedicated in all aspects of filmmaking. Nowadays it is rare to find films that focus on uniting people with good stories. Excellent film.
10,KelvinSelimor,"Aug 17, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick. Wind in your hair. A perfect example of what a cult movie sequel should be. For the intro, immediately +1 to the movie, a light opening under (You've Been Called Back to Top Gun)"" and then a transition in which planes start flying under ""Danger Zone""... It's just a berry on the cake. Continued on, my opinion turned out even better. On the one hand, this is understandable, technically everything has become much cooler and shooting from the cockpit and how the planes fly is one of the best things that is in ""Top Gun: Maverick"". The plot is also quite interesting, but it is precisely its task that rises before the pilots. And of course, a separate applause for Tom Cruise, who continues to amaze with his stunts and control of real combat fighters."
9,RefinedInsights,"Aug 11, 2023","A great movie, and a fantastic sequel, it restored a sense of wonder to the movie-watching experience."
5,BananaFloat,"Aug 9, 2023","Because of the horrible screenwriting that goes on for half the show, I can only give it 5/10. Because the last half of the movie is awesome (action, not horrible poorly written drama), I give it 5/10 stars."
9,Tom09,"Jul 21, 2023",It's nice to see this movie franchise to come back  since 1987 when the first on came out long waited and worth the wait
8,AgentLvi,"Jul 21, 2023","Great movie. The story is decent. The scoring is great, visual is really amazing, the voice & sound is also amazing"
10,DCosloff1999,"Jul 19, 2023",A remake sequel that respects what came before and passed the torch to the new characters to be part of a legacy done right.
9,DarkwingSchmuck,"Jul 8, 2023","Superior in every way to the original film, Top Gun: Maverick is a thrilling action movie with pinpoint direction.  The practical stunts are the star of the show, but this film also puts on a clinic as to how to properly establish stakes."
9,cris699,"Jul 6, 2023","A sequel that nobody wanted but that we all need.
Another deserved success for Tom Cruise."
8,yooples54,"Jun 30, 2023","Awesome movie with stellar action and plot. the acting was great and it had lots of ups and downs. the only reason im not giving it anything higher than 8 is because it didn't completely blow me out of the water, but it was an overall good movie, that left me feeling satisfied."
10,extrashotlatte,"Jun 11, 2023","For a sequel no one knew they wanted, asked for, or expected, Top Gun: Maverick was one of the best (if not the best) film of 2022, which reminds us why Tom Cruise is one of the few legitimate superstars of our time.

By now most people would have seen this film, which takes place 30 years after the events of the first Top Gun. Tom Cruise steps into this role effortlessly, and supported by a cast which is both cliché and endearing. Arrogant guy, chip on shoulder guy, takes-no-crap girl, goofy/nervous guy… but before you can start an eye roll, you find yourself rooting for these characters.

Cinematography, visual effects, practical effects all marry with such precision the resulting visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. The training sequence through the simulated route and dog fights give us a glimpse of what is to come. Combine this scintillating action with high stakes, impeccable acting and an absolute-gut punch of nostalgia, this film warrants multiple viewings. The sound design is remarkable. Both at the cinema and at home with a Dolby Atmos capable sound system, this film roars to life from all around you, and even overhead. If you caught this film in 4D – how good was it!

This film feels like the old Hollywood blockbusters where there’s a goal with some history/character arc, and the goal is ultimately achieved with struggle and growth along the way. Dialogue and chemistry between characters feels natural and real, which ground the otherwise the over-the-top plot.

Top Gun: Maverick is simple storytelling that doesn’t deconstruct established characters or lore, and that allows newcomers to earn their place."
7,CoolBR,"Jun 11, 2023","A good movie with a remarkable story and good action scenes also represents the dogfights well.

But, honestly, the movie lacks depth. The enemy country in the movie isn't even cited in the name. Worse yet, there aren't any named enemies, which is a shame, even if the enemy country is wrong it would be good to know why they are fighting for, instead they choose to burn a lot of screentime for a melodramatic relationship between the protagonist and one of his students/comrade (Rooster)."
1,JackEFlaps,"Jun 4, 2023","Awful.  Bland characters and nonsense script. The Rooster storyline was absurd.  Call backs every scene.  Tom Cruise was lame and awkward. I loved the original, but this movie is the worst I've seen in awhile."
7,BasilZero,"Jun 4, 2023",Not as good as the first Top Gun. A lot of the plot is pretty much a recycled re-telling except the main character is a instructor instead of a student. The new characters were not as memorable as the original cast of characters. The action scenes were nicely done however the ending act was just laughable and kind of makes you wish it was not included. It was so forced and felt like it would have been better if they did not have that last part of the movie.
9,o1nk,"Jun 1, 2023","Отличное кино!
Если рассмотривать как отдлеьное произведение, не оглядываясь на прошлые части, хотя связь с ними велика, то также все отлично.
Динамика, звук, картинка, стальные птички и небо.
Сюжет - он здесь не главное. Превозмогай, усердно трудись, не думай - все получится!
Пересмотрю еще через год-два."
2,Tiger_X,"Jun 1, 2023","Top Gun peaks in the very first scene wherein Maverick takes a cutting edge jet/spaceship to record breaking speed. We never see this awesome jet again or the intensity of this scene repeated. The entire rest of the movie features slow outdated airplanes in an attempt to save money and help the studio cash-in on nostalgia.

The supporting cast is almost as listless as Iceman's cameo. They rehash the entire Goose story in a really weird way with his son, Rooster! Finally, they tack on a new Maverick romance for no apparent reason (but to include the ""Labyrinth girl"") that is cringe and goes nowhere. Every single joke falls flat and the dog fights are not as realistic as the first movie.

Bottom line: Would never watch this movie again past scene #1 but I've watched the original Top Gun movie a dozen times."
10,nikTerry,"May 26, 2023","Dear Hollywood This is how you make a movie, great action, great writing, likeable but flawed characters, and not political pandering, just a whole lot of fun . A must see, a sequel done right, fan service done right."
10,fanimator,"May 14, 2023","Absolute masterpiece of a film, loved it from beginning to end. Best movie ever."
10,A13jandro,"May 4, 2023","ESTA PELICULA SE SINTIO COMO REGRESAR AL PASADO CUANDO SE HACIAN LAS PELICULAS CON MAS CARIÑO QUE CON EFECTOS ESPECIALIES . UNA JOYA, Y EL AUDIO UFF ."
8,Ralfbergs,"May 2, 2023",This was good and certainly more action and entertainment scenes than first one - still I understand why first one was cult classic since for those times it was unseen. I enjoyed it.
10,alerikanderson,"Apr 25, 2023",Top Gun Maverick is everything right about what a movie should be and is one of the best movies ever made.
10,Thor1001,"Apr 18, 2023","I was expecting it to be a bad movie because it was a sequel released more than thirty years after the first top gun and because Hollywood only lives on slot machines these days, but after watching the movie I recognize that it is one of the best movies of recent years."
8,LetsTalkStuff,"Apr 17, 2023",Damn good movie ass movie. No bs no annoying muh message. Just kick ass fighter pilot hijinks.
4,strangebrew123,"Mar 30, 2023",Predictable nonsense! Virtually no story of merit. Very poor script written by a ten year old? The only redeeming feature was the ability of the next generation plane to about turn on a sixpence. Don't bother wasting your time.
10,BlueGuyTalks,"Mar 30, 2023","The Top Gun franchise may be a bit older and more cliché than other films, but Top Gun: Maverick’s witty delivery and sublime action sequences make it a film worth watching in the forthcoming years.

FULL REVIEW HERE: ****/the-blue-critic/post/top-gun-maverick-2022"
7,tonyGreen,"Mar 11, 2023","The plot and cast of characters is a almost a beat-for-beat remake of the first film in parts. There is completely superfluous romance, unlike in the first film where it was a key plot point.
This film definitely caters to in a large part to the audience of the 1985 film 'Top Gun'. The score reuses a lot of the original film's score, definitely a lot of nostalgia smuggled in. Some of this comes across as slightly ludicrous. For example Iceman, sorry *Hangman*, is a big fan of Foghat and their 1975 hit ""Slow Ride"".

But the film stands out for it's great aerial action sequences, they really are spectacular, and the conflict and pressure around those really lifts the sense of peril for the characters.

The (unidentified) foreign nuclear program is destroyed, American Exceptionlism triumphs against the odds, A shining city on the hill etc. Good fun, especially the second reel."
3,lessacebola,"Mar 9, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick é um filme com inúmeros clichês, além disso, sua trama não foi interessante o suficiente para me agradar."
10,TheKingRyan,"Feb 26, 2023","Top Gun Maverick is an incredible film, the best film of 2022 and certainly one of the best action films of recent decades, photography, editing, sound and spectacular action scenes, Steven Spielberg is right Tom Cruise saved cinema."
0,xgamrx365,"Feb 21, 2023","This movie has a terrible script, horrible acting, and a woefully predictable outcome."
9,jlittle1404,"Feb 15, 2023","I’m not a big tom cruise fan but I respect his work. I saw the first top gun years ago and remember just a little. I have to admit though this was clean family fun and a feel good movie for this year that gets ppl back in theaters. My family and I enjoyed it so much! Great movie for my generation my parents, kids, and grandparents all."
0,Chrismackechnie,"Feb 14, 2023","I'll admit that I never cared for the first film, but after all the hype around this one, I decided to see it. It's about as formulaic as a movie can be. And it really wasn't much different than the original."
8,Jim222001,"Feb 6, 2023","A rare unnecessary sequel that might actually be better than the original. The first is known for being sexy and macho. With some fine action but the movie was always missing something.
The enemy jets just would show up out of nowhere pretty much was one flaw. Top Gun: Maverick is as sexy and macho. However, it’s story is better than the original and it’s just a better made movie.
When the enemy jets show up it’s just not out of nowhere and it makes sense. The movie could have turned into Behind Enemy Lines. I am grateful it doesn’t though since this is a fighter jet movie after all.
Tom Cruise and Miles Teller make a surprisingly good team. That brings back good memories of Maverick and Goose and it gets to you emotionally."
10,Zack2013,"Feb 5, 2023","O filme é incrível a história é simples mas que funciona perfeitamente, já quando se trata de fotografia o Claudio Miranda fez um trabalho incrível, a trilha sonora e músicas originais são marcantes, a edição de Eddie Hamilton é provavelmente a melhor edição de 2022 ! , Joseph Kosinski foi o diretor perfeito, os personagens têm personalidade é fácil lembrar de Rooster, Hangman, já as cenas de ação são incríveis e Tom Cruise mais uma vez prova que é realmente a última estrela de cinema."
6,JeBjBo,"Feb 1, 2023","a LOT of fan service but HOLY **** THOSE FLIGHT SEQUENCES

it's essentially a remake of Top Gun 1986"
10,StevenD,"Jan 20, 2023","One of the best movies of the year.
As someone who wasn't a big fan of the original and didn't expect much considering that its success was largely due to hitting at the right time I half expected this movie to be OK, but nothing more.
I was so surprised leaving the cinema to find myself excited enough to scream. Movies like this don't come every month, most of the time they don't even come every year or even decade.
I won't spoil the movie in any way since it's worth it to see it first hand but if your only thought is if it's worth the ticket there's nothing more to say that buy one and get ready for a great experience."
3,artguy1,"Jan 17, 2023","Lots of manufactured high-tech tension in the air, rote and hollow relationships on the ground."
0,Wally242,"Jan 15, 2023","Trite, completely predictable and when did Cruise become Yoda?  Blah, blah and blah."
6,SugarDickDaddy,"Jan 13, 2023","Entertaining? Yes. Good movie? No. It IS NOT Academy material, nor Academy performances, because people ""liked"" it. It received 2.5 Stars in 1986 and this is 100% a ""remake"". It is, Maverick grows up and acts responsible with a forced diversity cast. The rest of the movie is the same from cliched scenes to identical dialogue. Academy for cinematography, sure. A fun movie, yes. Best Movie/Actor? Come On!!"
9,fluffyhatmagic,"Jan 12, 2023","Pretty much the perfect summer popcorn blockbuster. Don’t really remember what happened and gained no insight into the human condition, but it was very fun watching the planes go vroooom."
8,mikesgold2K,"Jan 11, 2023","Niby to ta sama konstrukcja opowieści co w oryginale ale jednak nadal wciąga niemiłosiernie, bawi, wzrusza, podbudowuje. Samoloty robią ziuuum i jest w pytę"
5,Achaern,"Jan 11, 2023","It's a rare time an audience is so willfully disrespected by the writers of the film. To suggest there is no longer any need for even the smallest amount of context for who the bad guy is suggests this is really just about American Exceptionalism. ""It's right when we do it!"". The entire story pretext centres around murdering scientists, despite the movie not being about anything more than showboating airplanes. Maverick is a shallow, shallow character we never needed to revisit. This needs literally 10 more minutes in the writing room to make sense. The action sequences were well shot but so dumb, especially the Mach 10 sequence at the start where the movie jumped the shark right away. This could have been a *great* movie if Tom was never in the cockpit and essentially played the role Ed Harris briefly did right at the start. Did not like. Do not recommend. 5/10 for the movie making, 0/10 for the writing/story."
0,MarkoD,"Jan 9, 2023","Wow, they literally copy paste first movie, so BAD! Worst acting, worst directing, worst writing i have ever seen"

10,supermalik987,"Jan 7, 2023",There only a few movie deserves the 10/10 and top gun is one of them . Since COVID most movie went to streaming or it's in computers for short amount of time then goes to streaming quickly. Four months this was in Cinema . If choose to see this in standard and not Imax or Dolby but mostly IMax . What are doing to self.
10,Aravghostthised,"Jan 7, 2023","I love this film. The action is amazing, better than the first one.likeable characters. It's an amazing story and hit-songs to good with it. Must recommend"
4,diegoserena,"Jan 6, 2023","Only the scene with the planes, which are outstanding. This sequel is really poor"
8,AnActorExplains,"Jan 5, 2023","There is very little to be said about Top Gun: Maverick; that’s because it’s as close to flawless as a Hollywood production can get: Exhilarating cinematography, excellent audio both in fore and in background, premiere acting, a vibrant palette of colors in varied locations, and, most importantly, impeccable writing the likes of which we rarely see in this soulless, sellout era of film and television.

This movie has an incredibly diverse cast, with all the accompanying bells and whistles, and without any of the conceited, self-serving pretense of modern woke culture.  Top Gun: Maverick presents the argument that any man, woman or person of color is capable of excellence without sacrificing plot, contriving script, or assassinating character. It does so without any need to present the female in the guise of a male in order to elevate her, and without the need to crucify the male lead in order to satisfy a resentful audience.                                                                                                                                                                             What is most admirable about this movie is how it delivers on incredibly human themes that are vital, now more than ever before, to our current culture. Screen writers Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie seamlessly present extremely important themes such as selflessness, confidence, how to take a woman’s breath away, and how to create enduring friendships forged in competition. It even dares to present Commander “Iceman” Kazansky in a rather female light, as a patient, supportive, and compassionate authority. Take that, intersectionality! Family members of the enlisted will appreciate how director Joseph Kosinski does his very best to relay the incredible depth of feeling and emotion that is saying goodbye to a loved one that is headed into battle. All of this while developing a flawed protagonist who struggles to overcome his demons and deliver the best man he can be.                                                                        ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a true hero story, the likes of which we grew up on, and one that will inspire endless generations to come."
8,carlossolrac,"Dec 29, 2022","Tom Cruise is a god. Just agree and watch this. His character arc is flatter than the earth but wow cool flying scenes. Also, man o war, what country were they fighting? Are we too scared of PC culture that we don't have enemies anymore? Loved it."
9,busiek,"Dec 29, 2022","I'm not great fan of this kind films, but I just watched it: no lectures, just entertainment. And I like it! Probably best film 2022."
10,kendrastuck,"Dec 29, 2022",Best movie I have ever seen! They did such an amazing job at portraying what it was like to be a real life fighter pilot! A lot of effort was put into this movie when the actors were actually in the planes and it wasn’t a green screen effect. Truly a masterpiece.
10,Mobileum,"Dec 28, 2022",That's exactly the type of movie I like. Really good photography. No SJW stupidity. Just compelling to watch. I'm really not a fan of movie these days but if all looked like that I would become a cinephile.
10,Fractalius,"Dec 26, 2022","Exceptional... I'm normally not a fan of digging graves from the past, but when it's done well, it's amazing."
10,RevanJJ,"Dec 22, 2022","One of the best movies I’ve seen in a very long time. Cinematography, acting, music, action, story…all 100% on point. This is what we wanted! Watched it 4x in theaters and now on Paramount+! Don’t miss out on this!"
10,c6h12o6free,"Dec 22, 2022","Better than the original,  excellence and nostalgia abound.  It is a rare thing for a sequel to be this well done and faithful to the spirit of the franchise."
8,alanpotter17,"Dec 22, 2022","Maverick é um personagem irritante, assim como todos os demais, e ainda tem um romance insípido. A grandiosidade deste ""Top gun"" está no quesito técnico, as cenas de voo estão incríveis, da edição ao som, e a fotografia amarelada realmente ficou muito bonita e estilosa. Já o roteiro é o basicão de sempre, previsível até dizer chega. Se eu tivesse visto no cinema IMAX, talvez tivesse uma experiência melhor, já que o forte aqui é o sensorial. Ainda assim garante altas doses de diversão."
10,DeviousD,"Dec 15, 2022",One of the best movies of all time. It's crazy how good this movie is. It got me at the edge of my seat every second this deserves the highest ratings possible.
9,Dunkaccino,"Dec 5, 2022",A truly pure escapist entertainment. Tom Cruise has proven once again that he is a true movie star by making a real blockbuster: exciting and visually impressive.
10,CoreGamer1408,"Nov 30, 2022",This felt like a movie from a much missed and beloved bygone era and if this movie had of come out in that era? Then this movie would of been like maybe a 8/10 on the action hero scale. In 2022 it's practically a 11/10 now. The badass cool plane sequences didn't feel like the usual crappy CGI of current films. Yeah the plot was fairly simple. A do or die seemingly suicide mission against a high tech generic bad guy faction. Surprisingly this film had some heartfelt feels in some places and not just the Iceman stuff. One of those feel good triumph over adversity type of movies for sure. On reflection after watching this several times now the rewatchability for this movie is off the scale.
9,Wallncuz,"Nov 29, 2022","Idk if it's because the lack of any decent movies recently or its just that good, but this movie was great! So many movies are filled with bad cgi and this movie brings it back to reality. Definitely worth a watch or even a 4k disk for the house."
8,AncientSting,"Nov 27, 2022","Its is a great movie with spectacular scenes in the air, the characters are good and the plot is a improvement from the first one."
10,oneofjw,"Nov 26, 2022","Its original, its fun and the most important of all, its a great sequel. The reference were cool and the execution was fantastic."
9,CarlElmore,"Nov 25, 2022",A major improvement from the original film. It has some amazing action and direction from a film this year.
7,Robobob,"Nov 24, 2022","A fun flick with the real life fighter jet scenes that need to be seen to be believed.  I wish I could have seen it in iMax, but never got a chance.  One complaint is that it's funny that they never name the mysterious country in which the special mission is performed.. I guess to not anger any countries in which this movie could be shown.  You don't even get to SEE an enemies face to possibly give away which country it might be.  Kind of funny how hard they avoided it when you're looking for it."
10,valrond,"Nov 22, 2022","This movie is not perfect. No one is. But I'm giving it a 10. Why?. It's very good. It's better than the original Top Gun, it's well paced, it has likable characters, the story is simple (it's the death star trench basically), but a good movie doesn't need a complicated story.
The flight scenes are great. Probably the best ever in a movie. It uses quite a bit of nostalgia without abusing it.
But above all, this movie is very entertaining, as it should be. And it makes you feel GOOD when you watch it. You just can't ask for more."
7,JP32,"Nov 16, 2022","The celebratory energy of Top Gun: Maverick will enrapture plenty. But even accounting for Tom Cruise, Jerry Bruckheimer, and director Joseph Kosinski’s shrewd spell—the influx of timing and properly placed ambition, giving a starved audience the kind of entertainment they needed—Top Gun: Maverick is still a super-charged rush of fresh air; a summer blockbuster both jaw-droppingly thrilling and emotionally fulfilling."
10,user72817,"Nov 16, 2022","Probably the only decent film worth watching at the cinema in the recent woke times. Its really good to have this quality film with no preaching and just classic entertainment as it should be. Action, emotional and just fun with incredible effects which take your breath away. I was never sure about Tom Cruise but he has done an absolutely incredible job here and he deserves all the respect that is given."
8,KJ_20,"Nov 12, 2022","It's incredibly engaging and nerve racking. Top Gun: Maverick is a wonderful film which combines action and suspense, with emotion and loss. It's rare to see such a spectacular film in 2022."
9,gferl24,"Nov 9, 2022",This movie was exciting with a great cast. It is always nice to see a sequel not tarnish the reputation of the first movie. I can't remember the last movie that I've been to in theaters that has drawn such a big crowd.
10,FlashTommy96,"Nov 5, 2022","5min de filme e eu já estava segurando as lágrimas. Continuação maravilhosa que honra, homenageia e melhora tudo o que foi feito no 1º filme. Maverick faz o quase impossível 10x no filme e em todas você fica surpreso e pensa ""que f&da!!"". Um espetáculo cinematográfico emocionante. Admirar e celebrar o cinema é algo que eu amo, admiro muito o Tom Cruise pela sua carreira, por tudo o que ele fez e faz a essa arte.

""Don't think. Just do."""
10,Dragon_Fly,"Oct 30, 2022",Watch the 1986 one first; to follow the story.  It's even better when the easter eggs are found in the movie.
9,Maulcun,"Oct 27, 2022","I thought making a sequel to Top Gun wasn't a great idea until I saw this. Top Gun Maverick is easily one of the best movies that I've ever seen.

First of all, this movie doesn't make jokes at the expense of it's predecessor, pays tribute to the original in all ways it can , manages to keep the spirit of the original alive and yet surpass all expectations.

It is well written, good acting by all the supporting actors, great background score, beautiful action sequences, great direction and the movie teaches valuable lessons about life.

This will be one of the few movies I watch for a second time."
7,DHReviews,"Oct 26, 2022","While it may be hard for some to return to the Top Gun world after such a long distance between the films, Tom Cruise and company bring the franchise back into the limelight with the force of a F16. While nervous about the film in general, I knew I would have a good time watching it thanks to the sheer fact that Tom Cruise does nothing halfway. The cinematography within each cockpit, unique in its execution, is the major highlight of the film. While some aspects such as a relatively lackluster script and some average acting by supporting characters keep Top Gun: Maverick from reaching truly death-defying heights, lovers of popcorn movies will feel right at home and rightly thrilled. An enjoyable flight to say the least."
9,Larnyjeaney,"Oct 24, 2022","Great movie, well directed and surprisingly well-acted by Tom Cruise, funny at the perfect moments, great musical score, heartfelt and superb action. Best of all - no woke nonsense!"
10,gameareforfun,"Oct 17, 2022",better than original top gun movie in everyway...i can already say its one of the best movies
1,tdebug,"Oct 16, 2022","Not sure if you need to be some kind of “all american” person to give it 10 or if you must have a US military background yourself. Other that that, as a movie it’s pretty bad and full of real cheap scenes. It’s like watching some extra agitated ads booklet and not a movie."
4,Litigator,"Oct 15, 2022",Predictable rehash of the original. I didn’t really feel that the stakes were too high for the heroes. Seemed a fire gone conclusion and therefore the movie felt drawn out.
5,Miclazz,"Oct 11, 2022","I do not think this movie surpasses the original. It has no originality and will not to capture the imagination of a new generation. I do not think there will be any fun moments emulated and cemented into pop culture like the original had. In fact all those moments are simply recreated in the new movie.

The script and story is sub-par (no memorable lines) and I didn't feel any emotion for the characters. One area where they seemed to spend a lot of time and money is in the aerial cinematography and actually flying the actors while being filmed, and all you see as far as online reviews go is real-world pilots being asked to rate the flight scenes on their realism. Ok, great. But that doesn't for a good film make! I just wouldn't care to watch it again. I feels like Top Gun original meets ""Iron Eagle"" (from a story and acting perspective) + ""Star Wars IV"" (for how they essentially copied the destruction of the Death Star scene as the finale and highlight to the action).

There was no magic or chemistry between the actors, nor the intensity of the scenes like the original.
The music is recreated to a large degree and that's ok, but I'll take the grainy and raw cinematography of the original with it's creative use of scoring and editing and close up shots over this remake any day.

It is entertaining as a fun action movie, if you don't compare it to the Tony Scott original, ignore the cringeworthy premise of the ""mission"" they are training for and don't count the many scenes, shoe-horned into the movie, for the sake of nostalgia. Basically completely forgettable."

10,kevhorror,"Oct 6, 2022",Amazing 2022 film that ever made. I usually picked films that are must sees but this one takes almost a must see win!!
10,mp303,"Oct 5, 2022","Tom Cruise and cia. made some movie magic that Hollywood lost a long time ago. You can see it as the film develops into delivering action, drama and some comedy with so much balance that you leave the movie theater in awe of what you just seeing. Hope some producers take note with this masterpiece in my humble opinion."
9,MaxPayneIsGod,"Sep 26, 2022","I was truly skeptical about Maverick, I think the original movie is one of the overrated 80s action movies ever.

Great supporting cast and excellent action scenes.
It really is as good as they say it is"

10,Broker2022,"Sep 15, 2022","I watched the sequel to the 80s classic film Top Gun in the IMAX theater and was pleasantly surprised. The film starts off with suspense and continues to do so throughout the rest of the film. The story isn't important, it's all about pure nostalgia and Tom Cruise's outstanding acting. A declaration of love to the 80s. That's how I wish for future films. Exciting story, top acting performances and a well thought-out, technically well-written screenplay. Bravo!"
10,Starfree,"Sep 13, 2022","This movie gives the top gun fans exactly what we want. It doesn’t try and push anything, it’s just planes, guns, and overall epic action. Must watch"
9,evilspeculator,"Sep 13, 2022","Amazing piece of cinema. Tremendous camera work.

They opted not to green screen the action just because it was hard to shoot paid off. You can almost see the green screen in most of today's movies because the directors, actors, and audience have gotten lazy. This movie finally breaks that expectation and returns you to a more believable experience.

The writing is excellent but not perfect. They could have explored the relationship between Maverick and Penny a bit more. Instead, it feels like an afterthought.

What's amazing is that they honored the original and improved on it. Maverick will go down as one of the greatest sequels ever made."

10,chris519117,"Sep 9, 2022",I nominate this movie for best picture.  I saw it in IMAX and it blew my mind.  So much so that I saw it again the next weekend.  I have watched it twice since it came out on digital as well.  The action is a 10/10.  You can tell that there is very little CGI. Tom Cruise has always made great movies.  I cant think of another actor/actress (maybe Robert Downey Jr) that will have me going to the theatre solely on who is starring in it.  I would love to see one more!
9,JoA1973,"Sep 9, 2022","The call backs to the original film, like the shirtless ball game, were pretty lazy but overall a great movie. It captured the excitement of the first film well, and provided great escapist entertainment for a few hours. Well done."

10,bosrs1,"Sep 5, 2022","10/10 only because a higher rating isn’t possible. Easily on of the top 5 sequel movies of all time with Aliens, T2, Empire Strikes Back and Dark Knight and I’d say it’s the best movie of the last decade. It’s a nonstop literally edge of your seat thrill that has more heart than many movies thrown in for good measure that you will make you want to tear up at several points but also some well placed appropriate humor to balance it. Has just enough nostalgia to bring back good memories of the original, while working those references in organically so they don’t detract from the story this movie is telling. I’ve been caught saying this is what the Star Wars sequels should have been, a movie that introduces us to a new generation of interesting heroes who share the limelight, while still bringing us back an older, somewhat wiser, and more world weary version of our old heroes who are still very much the people we remember them to be from the old movie. Best movie of 2022."
10,chinahengst,"Sep 5, 2022",Movies are meant to entertain and did this movie entertained! You leave the theater feeling amazed and elated by what you saw on screen. Not much special effects but good old movie magic. Tom Cruise you the man!
8,Tongxi,"Sep 5, 2022",-2 Points for generic enemy and Mary Sue Maverick. The Rest ist still good.
4,Luke08,"Sep 4, 2022","Top Gun v2., with mandatory woke and ballgame shouts in supersonic flights. Scary to have such military with so much power under the thumb. All-predictable action and the usual Tom - nice, pro, cliche. Glen Powell was an under-used, brighter spot, perhaps. Wait for low streaming price, if any."

10,Click33,"Sep 3, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick is an extremely entertaining, fun, and engaging movie. This is the best sequel to a movie in decades, vastly improving upon a popular classic, while paying homage to the original. The cinematography, sound effects, and acting are all top-notch. It's so good to see a movie that's made with love and care again, using as much practical effects as possible, not overloaded with CGI. Best movie of 2022 by far and my favorite movie in many years."
10,Whipor,"Sep 3, 2022","Excelente película! Te da lo que vienes a buscar, acción, suspenso, tristezas, alegrías, aviones en combate, la recomiendo, si te gusta el cine que te entretiene y te hace olvidar todo, esta es tu película."
8,Kaonazhie,"Sep 2, 2022","Super fun movie. Almost not worth watching if you can't catch it in the cinema, as that experience is the one to go for. That said, even then it's a nice (if fairly standard) action movie with action-movie trope characters. Hits all the right sort of notes you'd expect, but the real star is obviously the aerial segments, which are ambitious and impressive. First film that got me back in the cinema since 2019."
9,eded9999,"Sep 2, 2022","It is a complete nostalgia feast? Yes.

It is full of fan-service? Yes.

Is Tom Cruise interpreting Tom Cruise again? Yes.

And that's exactly what i was needing in this sea of crap Hollywood produce this days. THIS is entertainment, not BS, no woke message, just 2 hours of ""forget the real word"" and enjoy a good, high budget, movie-star package, action blockbuster that respect and embrace the legacy of the IP their are using, no preaching, no hate to the original fans, just pure unadulterated entertainment.

Production is top tier, acting is good. I have nothing bad to say, the story is simple and there's a lot ""movie licenses"" with the stunts they do on the air, but that's it, the rest is a unapologetic and badass movie."
8,nnogohko,"Sep 2, 2022","This definitely is a must watch on IMAX. The flight sequences will make your jaw drop and the rumbling of the engines of those jets will stir your souls. This is an extremely simple but decent drama as well and of course Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Jennifer Connelly in particular really gives you the feels. Joseph Kosinski I think will finally be able to get multiple films to direct WITH A GOOD script after this one after Only the Brave disappointed financially. He directs the character scenes with a very nice touch and I especially loved the extended bar sequence where we get to meet the pilots. Although not as good as the last three Mission: Impossible movies in my opinion, this is another winner from Tom Cruise."
8,Chuker,"Sep 2, 2022",It shows how a sequel has to be done. Great action scenes. Great music. Tom Cruise has a pact with the devil
10,Butterballer1,"Sep 2, 2022","With low expectations going in, this film blew the entire audience away.  A sequel to a movie that no one was asking for, but it single-handedly revives the Western and American archetypes in a story that is universal and powerful.  Manages to hit all the right notes, and because it is sincere and heartfelt, the moments of disbelief are incredible--like a modern myth.  There hasn't been a film this good from Hollywood in years.  Going forward, I will never mock Tom Cruise without also implying my own extreme reverence.  Making this film the way he did required an intense amount of creative dominance over the studios and the ESG mob.  Hopefully, this film and the work of Cruise and the director inspire others to make films like this again rather than another 10 years of uninspiring bland cardboard."
9,RoccoCille,"Sep 2, 2022","This movie is a modern rarity, because it is a completely old school classically produced film, which is real action and character focused above all else.  It pays respectful homage to the origin story, and beautifully interlinks many characters to the current one.  This is actually better than the original, it’s more subtle, but has some fantastic dynamics on so many different levels.  One of the best movies I have seen produced by Hollywood in years, without any gross politics trying to be shoved into it, just a pure story with realistic characters and a well developed story arc across the board.  I also liked that Maverick is represented as flawed, now aging, but still the incredible talent that adds value to the younger generation of pilots. Highly recommended, this is definitely a movie I will watch many times."
10,Maverick19_,"Sep 2, 2022","One of the best movie experiences I've ever had, the story is quite entretaining, the special effects are amazing and the music mixed with the action scenes make this movie one of my favorites by far. Tom Cruise unsurpassed and in general it seems like a movie made with love and not a stupid and meaningless fan service. The scenes and cinematography are worth seeing. Good job 10/10"

If you can get past the mountain of plot holes though, and the overly simple  rinse and repeat story, you'll probably enjoy this. All in all this felt akin to what home alone 2 did for home alone 1. Same basic story of the first movie, just reskinned.

oh and the Jenifer Connolly / tom cruise, totally superficial romance plotline came off like a cialis commercial."

It is not only about action, the beautiful pictures especially the wide angle perspectives from the jets and the support from Pentagon with military aircraft. Tom Cruise is perfect and his character is well written. Also I like the critics about the hierarchy in the military, that was great.
The only thing I didnt like? Of course this movie is very political correct (""strong women"" in the beginning -.- ) and US propaganda (of course USA is allowed to bomb enemy nuclear **** problem). And some of the scenes resembled too much to the first Top Gun. In the beginning I was even thinking if I downloaded the right movie, lol. Anyways in my view this Top Gun is even better than the first one."

The NEED for a better sequel! - After hearing all the rave reviews I must admit to being a little bewildered, this is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen?! Just because it's not woke doesn't mean it's good. The script and acting are both nearly as terrible as Tom's hair dye. They should make a Top Gun Three-Some and bring back Meg Ryan and Kelly McGillis  - 5 stars for the admittedly great flying footage that for some reason reminded me of Star Wars?"

From Iceman's ""You have to let go"" to the ""Don't think"" lines, the inner core of this movie's soul is about how we as human beings navigate pain, loss, friendships, and brotherhood. And ultimately, how....despite it all, we must continue living past the pain of death and loss. THIS is why this movie is beautiful. THIS is why you can hear a pindrop while you watch it. THIS is why."

1,Broyax,"Aug 25, 2022","Voici la suite ou une espèce de suite du vieux film imbécile des années 80 au cours duquel Tom Bouse et ses talonnettes sévissaient déjà et excellaient en matière de prétention prétentieuse ! et d’ailleurs, lorsqu’il vient donner des leçons aux nouveaux **** cons de chez ‘Top Gun’, l’école d’élite, ceux-là sont carrément bluffés, estomaqués par autant de prétention… ils n’en reviennent pas !… et pourtant, Dieu sait qu’ils sont cons ! oui, le bon Dieu le sait, car tout cela nous dépasse.

Car en effet, encore un film à la gloire de Tom Bouse et en l’occurrence de son personnage de pilote de chasse sur le retour, qui sait tout et fait tout mieux que personne… pour une mission que l’on dirait tout droit sortie de Star Wars, le tout premier… sauf qu’on a remplacé les X-Wing par des F-18…!

Oui, ça en dit long sur le niveau de connerie, de beauferie, de ridicule du film entier avec en prime des passages psycho-dramatiques à la petite semaine, aussi grotesques que pathétiques. Et ridicules. Car so on peut résumer ce film en un mot, ce sera encore et toujours celui-ci, du début à la fin : ridicule ! ri-di-cule, putain de ridicule !

Du reste, tout n’y est pas entièrement mauvais et la réalisation est agréable, ni cut, ni move, juste normale. Et spectaculaire via des effets spéciaux évidemment au top. C’est Top Gun après tout malgré des longueurs regrettables soit dit en passant. Mais tout à fait fidèle au premier film, c’est un fait. Quant à dire lequel est le pire… je ne m’avancerais pas. J’hésite encore."

10,Voodoo123,"Aug 23, 2022",The fantastic cinematography and cast come together in a rare moment in which a sequel released so long after the original surpasses it so convincingly. Somehow it feels like anime levels of team bonding cheesiness mixed with military aircraft erotica and yet somehow it works for me. Very entertaining in an 80's cheesy way. Also as noted by several other reviews it's great to watch a film that isn't charged with the woke political garbage that has plagued all of Hollywood lately.
10,scho22,"Aug 23, 2022","My life movie: full of action, humour and a touching story behind  Well made indeed. Leaves a lingering message that will shock me always: past is past, time to let go ️   Never regret, and move towards the future"

يحسب للفيلم إنه بالرغم إنه واخد كتير اوي من الجزء الأول ومتمسك بيه لآخر فصل ومشهد وباني عليه الدوافع والتحديات الرئيسية لبطلنا وكل مراحل الفيلم الحاسمة ولكنه محافظ علي نفسه بالكامل كفيلم مستقل .. اه الفيلم جزء تاني صريح للجزء الأول القديم جدآ عكس ما توقعت .. وباني علي أحداث الجزء ده ومستعين بيها في لحظات كفلاش باك كمان .. ولكن قدرته الدرامية علي تسكين اللي قلته ده كله حلوة اوي ومتحسسكش إنك مسقط حاجة لو مشفتش الجزء الأول شبهي كده .. الفيلم عاطفي في المقام الأول .. وراس ماله هو مدي الشحن والطاقة اللي بيصدرهالك سواء تعاطف أو حب أو خوف أو توتر أو فرحة .. والمشاعر ديه والمشاهد اللي الفيلم استهلكها عشان ده يتحقق لو مأثرتش فيك الفيلم ملهوش طعم .. مع الأخذ في الإعتبار إننا في فيلم أكشن بطله توم كروز .. يعني لازم كل اللي قلته ده يكون وسط مشاهد اكشن طويلة ومليان طبقات وجهد ذهني وبدني .. مليانة تفاصيل عن الطيران كتيرة ولكنها لازمة وفي وقتها وسهل فهمها ومفيش اي حاجة اتقالت مش فعالة بل بالعكس تحس إنك عايز نفهم أكتر .. تعليقي الوحيد بس هو إني حسيت إن الفيلم بيزرع بعض اللحظات الحلوة جدآ ولكن غرضها هو أنها تشحت مشاعري بالعافية عشان تقوي النقلة للفصل اللي هيبدأ بعدها .. اه ده مكانش حلو  وحسيته كزا مرة.. بس الفيلم بيكافئك كل مرة بيعمل فيها ده .. وكل الممثلين اللي في المهمة كويسين اوي بس في اللي تم استغلاله وفي اللي كان مجرد عدد زيادة يخدم الدراما وتحس الفيلم مش لاقيلهم حاجة يعملوها .. فهما دائماً معانا علي الشاشة بس بروحهم .. لا بيحركوا الأحداث ولا مهمين في أي وقت وفي النهاية اللي شايف إن توم كروز مش ممثل علي الأقل يشوف بعض مشاهده الفردية والثنائية في الفيلم ده .. تحديداً مشاهد تفاعله مع ذكرياته أو الناس اللي ابتعد عنها وقابلها تاني فجأة .. Maverick فيلم مهم وقوي ومميز في تاريخ توم كروز .. علي مستوي الأكشن وده كان متوقع وفعلاً في شغل مبهر .. ولكن المفاجأة هي المستوي التمثيلي والتحديات اللي قصاد توم كروز .. الشخصية مش معقدة وأبعادها مش عميقة اوي ولكنها لها أبعاد ومن لحم ودم وعنده ما يكفي لإثبات كل شئ في صفه .. وطبعاً فيلم مهم جداً في تاريخ أفلام الطيران الحربي والمعارك الجوية"

6,argentshard,"Aug 11, 2022","Blatant propaganda film, and the actual mission is just a retreaded Star Wars Death Star assault, but still handled fairly well.

I appreciate that they continue the tradition of not identifying the antagonist faction/OPFOR, and actually got to fly the jets thanks to Cruise's demands.

The only cons I have with it are that it's a bit of a nostalgia trip, they think F/A-16s can somehow compete against SU-35s. (You are horribly mistaken if you think this is the case), and that once again America thinks they are liberator and goes to unnamed country to bomb them because ""they aren't allowed their own nuclear deterrence""...

but sure, good propaganda film."

I think today’s world would be a lot better if we as a nation internalized this film’s message about how it’s heroic and patriotic and cool when the military uses billion dollar jets to kill people for reasons that are unclear to the average citizen but make perfect sense once you realize we oughta put our faith into our military leaders. This country just doesn’t make sense to me anymore. I love America but I don’t live in America anymore this is WOKEMERICA and I can’t take it! I didn’t know the oil splashed on the boy, Ronnie!

This is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, the plane fight scenes are amazing. Cruise is his typical good self but it’s the supporting cast that helps bring the film to life, Jennifer Connelly, Miles Teller and specifically Glen Powell. I felt like some of the Iceman stuff felt shoved in, and the last act might’ve played it too safe, but other than that the film is pure popcorn entertainment."

Mas o Tom Cruise não se vendeu a agenda e fez o melhor filme da carreira dele, fazia muito tempo que não via um filme me deixava feliz."
8,MarkHReviews,"Jul 23, 2022","“Top Gun: Maverick” is an exhilarating film with no pretensions.  It just wants to be a first-rate diversion on a hot, humid summer afternoon.  By that measure, it exceeds expectations.  If you’re looking for an existential assessment of the human condition, go see “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”  If you want to examine the nature and texture of relationships, check out “Brian and Charles” or “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.”  “Maverick” is an unapologetic adrenaline rush that doesn’t have time to probe the darker corners of the human psyche.  So just sit back and savor Tom Cruise reprising his most iconic role.

This film works for three reasons: its visuals, its tone and what happens when there aren’t jets in the air.  Visually, “Maverick” is simply spectacular.  The dogfights and other aerial shots are all real, not CGI.  When you see the g-forces pressing on Tom Cruise’s face, that’s real.  This commitment to reality makes these action scenes even more riveting.

The tone of the film is equally skilled.  It’s self-referential without being self-absorbed.  There’s a bar where there are renditions of “Great Balls of Fire.”  There is beach football substituting for beach volleyball.  The admiral’s daughter (referenced in the original but never seen) shows up.  Most of all, there’s an appearance by Val Kilmer, who played fighter pilot “Iceman” in the original.  Here, he’s an admiral whose body is failing because of cancer.  He can speak only with great effort.  (In real life, Kilmer has battled throat cancer.  His brief speaking parts in “Maverick” are computer-generated.)

Finally, in “Maverick” the story keeps its footing even when it’s on the ground.  The original film was littered with excruciating dialogue filled with tortured clichés (“Your ego is writing checks your body can’t cash.”).  And because of Director Tony Scott’s advertising background, “Top Gun” featured way too many locker room scenes that just looked like product placement for Jockey briefs. By comparison, “Maverick” offers a cornucopia of interesting tidbits.  There’s a height-appropriate love interest for Cruise. (Jennifer Connelly is excellent.)  There’s also a surrogate father-son dynamic between Maverick and Goose’s son.  As a special bonus, Maverick appears incrementally more self-aware.  There’s even a female fighter pilot vying to become the gender-neutral alpha dog.

The plot is almost an afterthought.  After taking an experimental aircraft to Mach 10 in an opening scene, Maverick is assigned back to Top Gun School to train pilots for a suicide mission.  An unidentified rogue nation is engaging in uranium enrichment.  Maverick has to train pilots who will blow up the enrichment plant before this country can develop nuclear capability that will threaten civilization.  And so on.

A storyline that can be charitably described as “implausible” in no way detracts from the fun of this film.  In one of the three (count ‘em, three) climactic scenes, Maverick and his team attack the rogue nation, a country with plentiful evergreen trees and snow on the ground.  The uranium enrichment facility is three minutes from the coast.  Go to the biggest screen you can find to watch Tom Cruise bomb Norway."
10,Higgidan,"Jul 22, 2022","This was an inspirational piece of film by all involved and especially you know who.

My laugh out loud moment was when they seemed to improvise. I had the freedom to watch in one of Londons oldest cinemas, as they are called now. It is community ran currently. The local newspaper was nice and interesting. I found it on Google. I could not justify the exhorbirant price of the IMAX. The staff were very nice and I learned a lot from the guys at the desk. Definitely a ten because I felt the whole thing, and feel a lot better, now."
10,Jetsgame27,"Jul 21, 2022","Definitivamente una de las mejores películas de acción de este año y seguramente de los anteriores, hace mucho tiempo que una película no me emocionaba tanto como esta, es simplemente emocionante el ver desde la perspectiva propuesta como vuelan los aviones, los sonidos, y simplemente el guion esta bien estructurado, no hay partes que se sientan que están puestas ahí solo por relleno, la mayoría pareciera ser coherente, muy buena película la verdad."

3,TheGreenRoom,"Jul 19, 2022","To be fair, this movie does one thing extremely well. The jet flying sequences in this movie is top notch cinema, and it was extremely real and authentic without use of CGI. However, the greatness of the jet flying cannot overcome the ridiculousness of everything else in the movie. The dialogue was weird and cringe. Nothing about it seemed real and authentic unlike the jet flying. The love story was completely useless, and the plot is nonsense. It made me feel like the protagonists were the bad guys. Why would I root for someone who is going to other countries and dropping bombs on them unprovoked? This movie is nothing but a military propaganda film. Huge action and explosions with a weak plot and no substance. That's Hollywood for you."
5,TheWaffle,"Jul 18, 2022","Sometimes it just feels like I watched an entirely different movie than everyone else. The characters were paper thin, the dialogue was barebones, and the film was obsessed with callbacks to the original. I couldn't take the plot seriously, the mission they're training for is psychotically suicidal, and I couldn't even enjoy the aerial sequences since they ignored the laws of physics and just followed Anime-logic. I dunno, I must've just seen a different movie than everyone else."
10,Vadertime,"Jul 18, 2022","I remember seeing the first Topgun movie some 30 years ago. My wife and I caught it at the discount theater since it was already several weeks into it's run back then. We liked it, but I have never seen it again and it's not in my DVD collection. This one, Maverick, will definitely be in my DVD collection and after watching it this weekend in the theater, I may go watch it again in the theater. After the first 15 minutes, this movie is a rollercoaster ride with edge-of-your-seat thrills. In the 36 hours since I saw the movie, I continue to re-run it in my head. This one is so much better than the original, even with Tom Cruise in his late 50s when he made the movie - he's 60 now. I'm a few years older than him and I did not want to see an old  Tom Cruise in a Topgun movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Go see it. You will love it."

10,Migs2209,"Jul 2, 2022","What a crazy movie! It's hard to catch your breath afterwards. The first film in the saga was not well evaluated by critics and a sequel seemed impossible... It wasn't what Tom Cruise thought, because no mission is impossible for him. Cruise is and always has been a great actor. Here, he reinforces that and does even more. He puts other actors inside a moving fighter jet. He enters one himself. And it's to fly! Beautiful until the last minute. I can only fill every second of this job with praise. Every character is fun. The only core that doesn't fit is that of Tom Cruise with Jennifer Connelly. It took just one step to wrap that core in the gripping narrative. Even though it's the weakest core, it's still fun and sometimes funny. It's a homage with a chance to compare to the first film. What an honor to see this movie in theaters."

6,BlackSteelApexx,"Jun 30, 2022","Definitely not the Citizen Kane of our time, as one might errantly infer from the rave reviews both from critics and audiences. It’s always plainly obvious when a film studio sells out to the Department of Defense and allows them veto power over the script for the sake of getting military cooperation in terms of consultation and provisioning equipment for the film itself. The plot seems to openly embrace U.S.’s love for military adventurism, with the focal point centering around the planning of an airstrike on a uranium enrichment center that “violates a NATO treaty”. Who’s the “rogue state” operating the plant? What jurisdiction or right does the U.S. have to just bomb it? Because they feel like it? This is the early 2000’s Iraqi Freedom brand of warhawking that even the Republicans party has tried to distance itself from as of late. But then again, the DoD controls the script… and so not only is this presented as completely okay, but never are these moral concerns even addressed. So perhaps it’s better to just turn one’s brain off and view the movie through an appropriate lens - 2 hours of DoD propaganda that’s good for some action shots of (undeniably) stunning and beautiful fighter aircraft. However, the movie’s odd pacing and inter-splicing of a needless romance only serve to detract from what this movie could do well - being a 2-hour theme park ride showing the F-18 and its Russian opponents duking it out. The actual airstrike and dogfights afterwards in fact are so hurried towards the tail end of the film and short-lived that it feels like a lot of waiting for high-stakes action beyond the pre-mission training exercises, that the wait hardly feels worth it. It’s a good movie if you’ve got 2 hours to kill, but this movie is extremely overrated and held back by poor acting, strange pacing, unwelcome side plots, and a criminally short dogfight sequence that, if it were much longer, would have GREATLY improved my opinion of the movie overall."

4,Heywoody,"Jun 28, 2022","It's hilarious how everyone who is losing their minds over how amazing this movie is, are the same people who supposedly hate the ""Hollywood agenda""....unless they give them exactly what they want! (whether they even know what that is) Amazing jet fighting scenes make it all better.  lolololol  This movie is pretty dumb unless you are a kid. I liked the first one when I saw it as a kid. This one, well I'm not losing my mind over it, I'll just say that. The love hate relationship so many have with ""Hollywood"" is super cringe though!!!  lolol  Thanks for the laughs! I'll give it that. It made the haters bow down to big budget Hollywood, again. As always. Just admit you LOVE Hollywood movies, y'all!  Stop pretending to hate Hollywood SO MUCH then spend money every weekend to see the latest movie. lololololo You played yourselves. Cheers!"
10,waywardlaser,"Jun 28, 2022","Wow, dude…Tom Cruise **** cares. This movie absolutely floored me. A legacy sequel that not only eclipses the original, but exists on a whole nother level. Seeing this in IMAX is an experience I will not soon forget."

7,moviecritic68,"Jun 28, 2022","While I can't be too harsh since I was entertained, I can truly say this did not reach the level of the original story and the over the top hype it received. Not sure how they could have written the screenplay differently but it was too predictable. Some of the co-acting wasn't the best either. Producers waited too long for a follow up."
8,RD1996,"Jun 27, 2022","This was a worthy sequel. I went into the movie hoping it was not going to be a woke cash grab and fortunately it was not that at all. The story was great. The quality of the scenes are great. They used real jets. Not so much CGI except a few scenes where they needed to utilize CGI.  the cast was diverse... yet didn't shove it in your face like other movies nowadays. Despite a few scenes that made me think ""ok what is this call of duty?"" It was still a great movie. Must watch  if you're a fan of the first Top Gun."
9,Smoke43,"Jun 26, 2022","What an incredible movie, just a rush of emotions and nostalgia. This is how you do a sequel people.

I had high hopes for this one and they didn't disappoint, the story is quite rich and entertaining bringing ""Top Gun"" to the 21st century.
This movie might have the best third act I have seen in a long time.
Thank god no one died, that would have been a bummer.
Kind wanted to see Maverick getting a promotion at the end but that's alright.

8,KingDavidthe1st,"Jun 25, 2022","Oh come on negative nellies.  This movie was fun.  Did a great job tying back to the old movie, building out a new one with new characters and lots of fun.  Don't expect anything deep.  Expect to be entertained!"
10,Timmoore,"Jun 25, 2022","One of the best sequels to have been made in the last 20 years. Tom Cruise as good as ever, great supporting cast. Cheesey but enjoyable 80s style dialogue with a straighforward plot with some surprisingly good emotional tension between Maverick and Rooster. The straightforward storytelling stands in contrast to recent attempts to resurrect classic films from thhe 80s. The lack of political agenda and subversive storytelling makes this the sequel that most studios dont have the courage to make but that audiences can treasure."

EU ME SUPRIENDI MUITO!!! olha vou falar a verdade tudo do filme é bem feito, sim a história é rasa personagens até que genéricos, tirando um pouco o Tom Cruise, os outros atores e atrizes atuam muito bem, mas a MELHOR parte do filme e que é o ponto forte são as partes das naves, elas são muito bem feitas parece mesmo que eles estão em uma nave muito bem feito, você sente que eles estão pilotando e tudo mais. Espero ter te ajudado e é isso tchau."
9,LatinCritic13,"Jun 24, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick is how a modern day action movie should be when blending in the past and the present. Let's just say that Tom Cruise is still the best action star alive rapidly approaching 60 when he pulls off stunts like that. Surprisingly enough, the sound design in this film is what got me to love this sequel so much even if it's a standalone film. Top Gun: Maverick is without a doubt the best action sequels ever made standing right next to Terminator 2 and Blade Runner 2049. No weirdness, less modern day clichés/societal sensitivity, and more nostalgia that feels like an actual 90s movie. Thank God."
10,JPK,"Jun 23, 2022","One Of The Best Sequels Ever Made

After multiple delays and wondering when the film would come out, Top Gun: Maverick is finally here 23 months later than originally anticipated and HOLY ****! This is one of the absolute best sequels ever made with Flawless writing, Incredible performances, Extremely relatable characters, Intense flight scenes that have insane stunts, and Strong emotion put into it. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is up there with The Godfather Part 2, The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Terminator 2, The Dark Knight, and Blade Runner 2049. GO SEE THIS FILM!"

5,Enerla,"Jun 20, 2022","The prequel is a legendary film. Some would say the prequel is a ""bromance"" film. Others point out how it is an important film to LGBT community. When Hollywood forces woke stuff on non-woke franchises, and the resulting story lacks integrity and characters, we often point out, they should create sequels to important ""LGBT"" stories, they should make films about real black characters, black history, etc. as it can be done with taste, and can still lead to a good story. Top Gun: Maverick is a missed opportunity in this department. While the action and the visuals are great, it is a story supposedly about relationship, and with that it is a missed opportunity. When ""only the core of the movie is bad"" that is an issue. As a modern day average action flick it would be excellent. As a continuation of Top Gun and a film that focuses on relationships? It is a huge missed opportunity."
10,stratos_au,"Jun 19, 2022","Non stop action. Yes the movie might not be for everyone, yes the movie doesn't have major plot twists and the cinematography is great amazing shots and almost no CGI.

It was a breath of fresh air - just a good old-fashioned entertaining action movie. Story is simple, but effective. Effects are mostly practical which gives a nice weight to the action. Tom Cruise proves he's still got it, and other performances are good as well. It was well-worth the price of a theater ticket."

10,mxs1438,"Jun 15, 2022","I saw this movie yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. I thought the original Top Gun was a great movie and it was a big surprise that 35+ years later, a sequel was made.

The sequel is based on the original Top Gun and takes the movie to new levels that are astonishing in many different ways. Obviously, the action scenes are completely amazing. Beyond that, this is a movie very much about relationships. Relationships about teams and relationships focusing on 1-1 dynamics. Painful history with a lot of hope and suspense to see how it unfolds.

In the end, the most significant aspect of this movie is Tom Cruise’s performance. He truly inhabits the character Maverick. Tom Cruise is one of the best actors of the 20th and 21st century and he proves it again and again in this movie.

Hint: Watch/Re-watch the original Top Gun, then run out to see this movie."
9,barryburton,"Jun 15, 2022",Just a lot of fun with lots of nostalgic nods to the original. Highly recommended as an action film for some escapism.

Scenes from the first movie are replicated the perfect way and that is how you pass the torch to a younger generation. The movie honors the characters and that's exactly what I wanted. It brings out so many emotions I can't ****'s a rollercoaster in every way. At some point you think the movie is over, but it keeps going and it only gets better. The original score completes this amazing movie."

9,theredsky,"Jun 14, 2022","Miles better than the original 1986 film and one of my favorite sequels of all time. God this film is just awesome. That’s the best way to describe it; awesome. The flying is awesome, the characters are awesome, the music is awesome, and the action is awesome. Tom Cruise’s dedication to making realistic action films with little to no visual effects has paid off incredibly well here. The flying scenes were filmed practically but they look amazing. Some of if not the best shot sequences of the year so far. I absolutely adore how they look and it’s amazing that the actors were able to act in those conditions. They all do a great job acting. Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell are all standouts here and their respective characters and journeys were really well done and even compelling at points. Val Kilmer did a great job as well under his own personal circumstances. The film handles Kilmer’s medical condition and character incredibly respectfully. It’s a great handling of his character. The action here is awesome. It’s incredibly well thought out and intense. You could know or predict the outcome of a scene and you could still feel your heart beating out of your chest just because of how well done the action is. It’s genuinely some of the best action in a blockbuster that I’ve seen in a long time. The final action scene itself is probably my favorite action scene of the year. It’s absolutely amazing and so much better than the final fight in the original film because it’s actually set up. The music here from the original Top Gun composer, Lady Gaga, and Hans Zimmer is great! The soundtrack itself isn’t near as good as the original 86 film but it’s still great here. I can’t wait to see how Cruise breaks the mold with action again in the future. This is a must see from me for everyone. This film deserves to break $1 Billion at the box office so go see it now!"

10,Gamelore,"Jun 13, 2022","Count me shocked.  A movie about concrete and boats and gray metal, infused with such a well-crafted drama that it leaves me bawling for 15 minutes.  The movie truly was perfectly calculated to achieve an optimal climax.  It hit all the notes.  Extremely rarely does a movie get me deeply invested in the struggle; somehow, through character interactions, I totally invested.  And the struggle -- my god.  From so pathetically desperate, to pure win -- fantastic."
9,BeardedYoda,"Jun 13, 2022","As someone who hasn't even seen the first TOP GUN movie, only knowing a few story details, I can honestly say that TOP GUN: MAVERICK is a very enjoyable and very well done film. The movie is worth watching, even if you haven't seen the first film. This movie may not do anything ""new"", but it does a lot right. I definitely recommend checking this blockbuster out."
6,Gamer2077,"Jun 13, 2022","This movie teaches you two lessons.

9,skykappah,"Jun 12, 2022","This is a classic old school blockbuster in every respect. You know it's a good movie when it clocks in at over 2 hours and it seems shorter, hardly a boring moment. I prefer it over the original in that the story flows much better because the first one was bogged down with the 80's need for cringey love themes.

One of the few films where the sequel is better than the first.
It's the perfect end and hopefully they leave it at that."
9,MYReviewNAME,"Jun 12, 2022","A true successor to the original movie. Capturing the nostalgia from the original Top Gun: Maverick doesn't just try to follow in the footsteps, but instead the movie becomes a new classic. A rare sequel that doesn't always exist in movie franchises."

5,Davidsco27,"Jun 10, 2022","The 2nd half kind of saves it, kind of, but this was a HUGE disappointment, especially after all the gushing reviews.  Maybe Cruise is working his Scientology crap on them.  Some of the WORST directing, acting and script I have ever seen, and I'm a huge movie buff.  LOVE the original, it was fun, this is almost an embarrassment. I've never seen a poor Jon Hamm performance until this, and Cruise is obviously in cruise mode lately as he hasn't made a decent film since MI3 and is now just riding the mediocrity train to the bank.  I have really gotten sick of these check the box films now too that ensure every race, creed, nationality and sex is equally represented for no artistic reason other than to appeal to everyone.  I have NO idea what the woman pilot was doing there, and she could've easily been replaced by a mannequin.  Connolly was boring and wooden.  The flight scenes ranged from meh to good, the music was bland, poorly used, and NOWHERE as emotion stirring as the original. The Val Kilmer treatment was a saving grace, but come on viewers and critics. There's no way you're keeping it real, or maybe you saw a different film. Maybe after a long theater absence you've lowered your standards and expectations and are just to eager for a great theater experience.  I get that, we all need that fun again. For me, this just wasn't it"
9,ThinkLiveLife,"Jun 10, 2022",Really solid movie. This has to be one of the rare times the sequel is actually better than the original. It really shows that they did not cheap out and go full CGI with the small details like seeing the pilots genuinely react to the maneuvers they pull that stand out.
8,elisejj,"Jun 10, 2022","Loved the original Top Gun movie, even named my dog Maverick after the movie but thought this one fell a little short. Tom Cruise movies usually has a lot of action and not a ton of talking which was the same case with this movie. That wasn't a big problem for me, but it was slow in some parts. I personally would have liked to get to know the pilots he was training more or had Maverick build relationships with them more to add more depth or shake it up in parts more to keep the audience's attention. Still would recommend you see, but I would get the free ticket from Applebee's first or wait to watch it when it comes out on TV."

10,DarthLeon,"Jun 10, 2022","Aliens, Empire Strikes Back, Godfather 2... Sequels that are on par or better than their original. Top Gun: Maverick deserves that distinction in spades.

9,Nuajo33,"Jun 10, 2022","Gros travail sur ce film, les scènes d'action sont incroyable, et Tom Cruise est au top.

10,robomartion,"Jun 9, 2022",It's really visceral edge of your seat no nonsense entertainment. Its biggest downfall is also its greatest and most stand-out unique quality and that is it never delves into the area of fiction like a James Bond film and is realism all the way. It feels almost like a real life account of what it would be like to be in an elite air force. The practical effects. It also sets the bar on how to do a reboot and I'm sure will make a lot of people think about signing up to the Navy. It is a true American film and gets the full 10 for not labelling any particular country as the enemy as well as for minimal drama with no unnecessary bickering manufactured division between the crew. Its all about team work.

10,MusashiMoto,"Jun 9, 2022","One of the best openings to a movie I have seen in many years.  Excellent pace and expertly directed action sequences.  They just don't make films like this anymore, and I got a little sad watching it in the theater thinking ""I will probably never see another movie like this again.""  The majority of writers in Hollywood today are untalented weak minded hacks that are not capable of doing anything close.  The hero arc for Maverick is well crafted and the production had immense respect for the character.  This is a far cry from the majority of sequels and reboots made lately which seek to deconstruct and tear down beloved characters from the past in order to build up pathetic new characters that usually act like narcissists.  I will go see this movie again, and I haven't said that about a big budget film for a long time."

2,onefjef,"Jun 9, 2022","I haven't seen such a lazy piece of mainstream garbage since the adaptation of the board game Battleship. They basically just remade the first movie, but way worse. The only redeeming thing about the film is the hot airplane action, but even that becomes boring after a while. Just because it's a mainstream film doesn't mean it can't be creative or different in some way, Top Gun Maverick feels like it was phoned in. You can do better, Hollywood, I know you can."
10,FatzJim,"Jun 9, 2022","Great movie. Well written, shot, and a great acting. This is reminiscent of older well done movies that didn't need to preach to you or tell you what everything was and how you should feel about it. Great sequel. Also, pays homage to the past."

This movie is free of politics, it has very little political correctness, so it is pretty much free of so much annoying stuff that plagues today's movies. Definitely worth the trip to cinema."
9,LordGanon,"Jun 9, 2022","Very good sequel to the first one, no political statments, no hate, very good action scenes."
9,CTAN,"Jun 8, 2022","Even better than its 1st movie, love it!! If you haven't watch this, highly recommended."
9,joeyabuki,"Jun 8, 2022","Great movie. Excellent movie. It's perfect.

After 36 years (1986) Tom Cruise returns with the second part and THEY THROWED THE HOUSE OUT THE WINDOW. What genius. He has the perfect action and characters that make you yearn for the 80s."
10,zyler,"Jun 8, 2022","Gave me an 80s vibe while being modern, very rarely do I get a movie that gives me that sort've nostalgic feeling but with modern cinematography. Enjoyed the characters and humor. One of my favorite new movies in recent years."
10,rutin21,"Jun 8, 2022","A must see movies 2022 so far i think, i hope this movie could be nominated for oscar best actor and best picture."
9,dharma,"Jun 8, 2022","After many decades, Tom Cruise returns to the blockbuster that put his name on the map, Top Gun. this film joined an elite group of sequels that are better than the original.  I can even say that it is one of the best Action film of the last decade. Amazing set pieces, cinematography and sound editing. Sequences filmed live, with the actors actually flying these fighter **** dropping to say the least.  This is a film that need to be seen in an IMAX screen, or the very least any kind of cinema.  However, all these razzle dazzle will be for naught without the human characters and that is what Top Gun excels in all front.  This may be the Tom Cruise show but is also an ensemble piece, with all actors in their A game.  One of the best film of 2022 so far."
9,ReViEwSs,"Jun 8, 2022",Better than the original by quite a bit while still retaining everything fans could want from the original. Well worth the price of admission.
10,Securion,"Jun 8, 2022","Just perfect in every way. Completely devoid of wokeness. An amazing film.

10,RyanRetroGamer7,"Jun 8, 2022","This has got to be the best movie I have ever seen in theaters! I will even say I prefer it over any of the marvel movies.  And yes, I do love marvel, so that’s really saying something.  Go watch this movie! It honestly surpasses the original!"
8,Experiment626,"Jun 8, 2022","Lots of fan service, but done in a good way.  It does rehash the first movie, but it felt fresh.  Liked how they evolved Maverick's character.  I do think the ending was changed.  The last 15 to 20 minutes felt tacked on and out of place.  But that didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the movie.  Do recommend.  If you have access to see it in a 4DX theater (motion based), and don't get motion sickness, I highly recommend giving it a chance."
10,DALLLY,"Jun 7, 2022","Amazing movie. I havent seen the first one. But man, it was really good. I Love the details of the movie."
10,Blokin,"Jun 7, 2022","Uncompromising entertainment. I can’t even remember when I saw a movie or a show last time, where I wasn’t also given an uncomfortable amount of social studies lecture. Maverick is a breath of fresh air in a time when audiences are not allowed to just switch off from the depressing reality that is life, and immerse themselves in an exciting story. This movie is delivers flawlessly what it promises, what you’d expect. Plainly speaking, its a perfect movie for what it is."
9,ItsMainman,"Jun 7, 2022",This is a real Hollywood movie with all the charisma and charm of a classic blockbuster. The score is exciting and emotional and the pacing kept me on the edge of my seat afraid to blink in case I might miss something. As someone who never really loved the original film I’ve found a new respect for it as this sequel is a masterclass in cinema.
10,Arkham26,"Jun 7, 2022","Exceptional in a good way, this is totally new to the industry. Years of delay due to covid, but still the best movie yet and definitely for more years to come"
9,drlowdon,"Jun 7, 2022","Thirty years since the events of the original film, Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is serving as a U.S. Navy test pilot when he is sent to act as an instructor for a group of elite pilots at the TOPGUN academy.

Top Gun Maverick is undoubtedly one of the best action movies of the last decade with absolutely staggering flight scenes that just have to be seen at the cinema. Even the plot, which is pretty much as predictable as it gets, somehow still manages to prove suitably emotional. Just a great movie all round."
10,Metzerck,"Jun 7, 2022","Amazing movie, i don´t remember any aircraft´s movies with this level of realism, also the characters are very well interpreted, the script is well writen, and also, the music of this movie is just fantastic... if i could put more than 10, i would."
9,Pikapalooza,"Jun 7, 2022","I really enjoyed the movie - it stayed true to the characters, didn't interject too many modern trends, and had a ton of practical effects vs cgi heavy stuff.  The story was simple and not overly complicated.  Made me feel like I was a kid again watching the first one."
9,Pbork,"Jun 7, 2022",Fresh yet nostalgic . Tom doesnt age . Big budget movie with superb results.
9,Deviltherobot,"Jun 7, 2022",A great sequel that is better than the original. I am going to see it again in IMAX
9,dave_a,"Jun 7, 2022","I really liked this sequel. Yes it has its cringe moments but in a way that also improves the movie. Looking at 2022 and the movies that have been release so far this is really one to watch. This was also awesome to watch in 4DX so if you have the opportunity, definitely go experience that.

Rating it a 9 because it's awesome but some small things could be improved."
10,MaxMad2099,"Jun 7, 2022","All I wanted in a movie. Action, love, epic moments, good music.... No political or moral trials ... Just fun.
Great tom cruise, he looks 20 years less!"
10,Telsatall,"Jun 6, 2022",Such a great story. I thought going to the theaters on week 2 would be a good time to see the movie. We couldn’t get decent sheets in the theaters. It’s been probably a decade since I haven’t been able to get good seats on week 2 on a film.
10,iVincent,"Jun 6, 2022","Go and watch the movie in the cinema now. The best movie experience ever.
Them actions scenes were unbelieveable and the sound is so good. Great acting from everyone. Best sequel ever."
8,intruder313,"Jun 6, 2022","It does stray into 'too silly' territory towards the end, but for the most part it's an excellent sequel that remains more.....grounded."
8,Chaos_Luke,"Jun 6, 2022","hab Teil 1 nicht gesehen, aber war top und werde das nachholen... Den Rest fülle ich mit Spam, um das Zeichenlimit zu umgehen. Gibt aber einen Daumen hoch von mir."
9,Mattyice,"Jun 6, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick ends up being one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original classic in almost every way. Adding depth and gravitas to the story, as well as gorgeous cinematography and stunt sequences, while retaining some of the cheesiness, humor, and charm that made the original an 80s icon. Tom Cruise is obviously the stand out of the cast with a fantastic and shockingly emotional performance, but the rest of the cast is great as well and the new pilots all have their own charm, although I did find Miles Teller's Rooster to be a bit miscast. The only cons I really have for the film are the fact that it's a bit too heavy on exposition for both Maverick and Penny's, as well as Maverick and Rooster's, relationships. It's depiction of the ""enemy"", which is clearly Russian/Chinese yet isn't stated as much or shown, is also odd, but studios want to make money and not get this movie banned from those countries, so it's understandable albeit clunky. Otherwise, Top Gun Maverick is one heck of a ride and a very worthy trip to the cinema."
10,levorato,"Jun 6, 2022","Outstanding. Some breath tanking scenes, it was really a pleasure to watch."
9,McGamor,"Jun 6, 2022",An excellent movie that shows what can be accomplished when there is no woke propaganda added. Its a very patriotic and faithful sequel to the original.
9,cruel_frames,"Jun 6, 2022","I was blown away! This is what filmmaking in 2022 should look like! Visually I haven't seen anything like this. Sure, CGI was improved in the last years, but nothing beats the real thing. They actually put the actors in real F18 jets and you can feel this! I am still gushing aboout this film! I hope it smashes the box office and shows to hollywood what people want! I am tired of politics, the M-SHE-U and the recent 100% green screen productions."
10,Grendizer,"Jun 6, 2022","One of the best and intense cinema experiences I witnessed. Very enjoyable movie and truly mate to experience on a big screen. This movie feels and looks like an 80s movie (in a good way). They captured the atmosphere perfectly. It won't win any prices for acting or script (just normal neither bad nor good), but I think this movie isn't about that. It was a joy to watch it and will see it today for a second time. A good 80s action flick brought into our time."
9,Jones76,"Jun 6, 2022",[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
10,Ruegrong,"Jun 5, 2022","A Sequel to the 800's original that actually surpassed expectations. The Movie has everything you can ask for in a film. The authenticity that is displayed on screen is the best I have ever seen, with the actors in actual cockpit. I would love to see more films share the same dedication and hard work put into their films. Top Gun Maverick has set the bar pretty high"
7,Nimin,"Jun 5, 2022","I liked this movie because of the flight and action scenes. However, it's totally forgettable."
9,JeremyDeb,"Jun 5, 2022","Awesome movie. Loved it more than the first. Amazing flying sequences. Story was somewhat believable, if a little predictable. Nostalgia was great too."

10,T4p0utxfr35h,"Jun 5, 2022","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Tom cruise is showing hollywood how to make the best A+ movies. There wasn't a dull moment the entire movie. All seat gripping, cheering, and and anxiety moments."

9,RayneGokce,"Jun 5, 2022","The movie is excellent, you will definitely not regret it. The movie starts off well, with a little bit of classic comedy. On the other hand, they reflected the emotion well, the film director makes you feel the emotion while watching it. The shooting quality is good, the actors are well acted, the setting is nice and the subject is well chosen. It's hard to find a good action and drama movie these days and Top Gun is in my opinion a great movie that makes up for the current lack of action and drama. There should be more movies like this."
9,Drakan,"Jun 5, 2022","Old-school, no CGI effects, no LBGT politics hard selling us 'The Message', etc. Just a great summer movie & popcorn."
10,Taylo226,"Jun 4, 2022",The movie is fantastic. It is devoid of the current woke nonsense Hollywood puts out these days. also in theatres is definitely the way to watch it.
10,xDWx,"Jun 4, 2022","Totally fun and not at all woke!  It starts out a little slow, but the second half where they get to the actual combat is awesome.  Using real jets makes a HUGE difference.  Everything feels real not like all the fake green screened CGI you get with most movies.  I left the movie theater loving this, can't wait to see it again!"
10,Justin22,"Jun 4, 2022","Awesome cinematography, great script and awesome acting. Best film I’ve seen in a while"
9,Halonut24,"Jun 4, 2022","It's a real treat in this day in age to have a sequel to a beloved classic film that actually fulfils the role of, well, a sequel. If you haven't seen it, or are debating seeing it, debate no longer. This is must-watch stuff right here. Go see it immediately.

To be entirely truthful, I fully expected this film to suffer from the same pitfalls all of these sequel/remakes do in today's age; to spit in the faces of the original, and re-make it in their own twisted image. Re-write characters to fit a new narrative. Break down their legacy into something unrecognizable. Like what Disney did to Star Wars over the past decade.
To my utter amazement, it never did. Not even a little bit. Every second of this film was totally respectful to it's 1986 predecessor. Almost all action seen is practical. Those F-18's were real F-18's, flown by real people, filmed with real cameras, and it's a sight to behold. The sound design beautifully translates the incredible power these machines possess. It's characters remain untarnished from revisionism. Maverick is still the same Maverick we knew all those years ago. The new characters are written realistically, with care and diligence. Our hero's struggles are approached with dignity and respect. Ulterior motives, personal politics, all absent from the film. With all of it wrapped in just the perfect amount of nostalgia tastefully sprinkled throughout the 2 hour runtime. Enough to harken back to it's roots, and tug on a few heart-strings, but it never dwells on it. Something this authentic and genuine needs to be openly praised and cherished. This is what we should expect sequels, and to that extent action films in general, to be. What a wonderful surprise."
9,Jedimiller1,"Jun 4, 2022","Very enjoyable, it doesn't suffer from throwbacks to the original, it tries to be its own movie and succeed. Also no woke garbage agendas."
10,rAMZA,"Jun 4, 2022","One of the best movies i have seen in a long time, lot of nostalagia and got even a little tears in my eyes. I was probably 6-8 years old whe i did se the first one, been a long time to wait for this ""second mission"" :)"
9,ScotterMonkey,"Jun 3, 2022","Nostalgic, touching, fun, exciting. Simple but exactly what I wanted and expected. Only thing I'd add is more music during the flying."
9,brennenmorrow,"Jun 3, 2022","While I wasn't the biggest fan of the original film back in 1986, the sequel was incredible! The dedication that all of these actors had for this movie was unbelievable. While it's a very predictable film and I don't exactly consider it to be groundbreaking, it's a perfect sequel and ending to an iconic original. I consider this to be an improvement upon the original in many ways."
9,SpectreCMD,"Jun 3, 2022",An amazing sequel that takes the original and actually improves upon it! I went in and actually got more of a movie than I expected. Worth the ticket price.
10,DoctorJemima,"Jun 3, 2022","Fantastic movie. Great pacing, story, action sequences, and did not lean too much on nostalgia. Best way to watch is definitely in theaters or with a great sound system."
9,Reviewer917,"Jun 3, 2022",Absolutely great movie.  This is how movies should be made.  No social justice nonsense.  Just good acting and a good story.  It is must see.

10,roadrunnerz45,"Jun 2, 2022","36 years in the making. Who would have thought it would ever come out. What a spectacle. Plot is questionable but the action is edge of the seat stuff, the opening scene and the test course is hair raising. Cruise makes it happen, even after all these decades he is spectacular. There's a few telling quotes in there about time running out, but fortunately for us it was indeed, not today. Appreciate this once in a generation actor while you can and feel the need for speed."
9,jameshowlett89,"Jun 2, 2022","this is what you want from your entertainment.... no bs no forced politics, just fun content to watch. the action was amazing with either none or very little cgi(i couldn't find any) and one of the only movies in recent memory that actually kept me on the edge of my seat at the theater."
10,mrniceguy44,"Jun 2, 2022","The plot is as flat as, wel you can think of something. But the great cinematografie, tension, 80s vibe and acting makes 100% up for it. And real life jet scenes make all the difference from all to common blue screen."
10,vlalalad,"Jun 2, 2022","Just a great overall movie. Does not take itself too serious, but it made people in the audience cry. Great music, nostalgic feeling, incredible action scenes! Worth every penny, too bad there are so few movies of this level nowadays."
9,SaintOzz,"Jun 2, 2022","Its as good as ppl are saying in fact IMHO its one of the best sequels ive seen
in many many years.  I left the theater just happy its that kind of feel
good movie!"
9,HowToBen,"Jun 2, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick is a phenomenal example of modern-age cinematography. The 3-year delay for this movie is justified by the final product we are fortunate to see. It is far too common that Sequels for Standalone films are produced purely for 'nostalgia money' but Top Gun: Maverick is an anomaly of modern-age filmmaking. My respect for the cast and crew was further enhanced by the knowledge that they used practical effects and put the actors in actual Military-grade fighter aircraft. Too often are films quickly made and rushed with the use of CGI and it is incredibly refreshing to see a movie created with sheer passion and commitment to creating this sequel. I was not born to witness the original, but my Mother and her Friend's enjoyment in the cinema proved to me that this movie whilst bringing a new plot, could also pay homage to the feeling of the original.

The story is told in a manner that is neither boring nor underplayed, and the return of iconic actors in a realistic way further enhances the respect given to the original. Although there are elements of the plot that are bland, the feeling of the movie suits the narrative. The actors all deserve huge credit, not only for their performance but also for their dedication with flight-training to partake in their roles to the best of their capabilities.

This is a great movie in a time of over-saturation and CGI, I am so refreshed to see a movie that does not rely on the use of CGI and soleless storytelling, more like this, please."
10,Barti7i,"Jun 2, 2022","Just created account to rate this movie...Absolutely stunning, simply epic sequel. I'm speechless."
10,mickrussom,"Jun 2, 2022","A rare sequel - this one is actually better than the original. If this was a stand alone movie it would be a seven/eight of ten. But as a sequel navigating the modern outrage mobs and other cantankerous spoilers and wreckers waiting in the wings to bring anything good down this thing is a solid ten. Tom Cruise doesn't look almost 60, he is in unreal shape for any age, but the work and dieting he must put in to look like this at 59 is nothing short of amazing. There is less cheese than was in the first movie, the music is great, and to see these people grunting and huffing while pulling real g-force maneuvers in real airplanes is so great. Tom Cruise had to take a huge amount of abuse to make this a reality - you can see the actors in planes sweating and suffering tunnel vision and black outs and redouts. One must have a healthy  respect for Tom Cruise for being one of the very very few in hollyweird that actually cares enough about his craft to put in the work. I hope this kicks off a new wave of serious remakes that can even outshine the original if done right and I hope this kicks off a new wave of movies that skip the idiotic computer generated trash and get back to practical effects like this movie. This is basically an 80's movie done right - take all the good music and good looking people, reduce the cheese and come up with an engaging multi-faceted multi-layered plot that develops emotion and take it to eleven on a scale of ten."
7,beefalo16,"Jun 2, 2022","Overall a good movie and worth a watch for anyone who enjoyed the first one. Definitely some fan service, but movie also holds up on its own.

Main complaints holding it back from a higher rating:
1) Really needed a large dogfight scene, feels like so much wasted potential here. We didn't get to see all the pilots in action and a lot of the training seemed like it was irrelevant.
2) Zero attempt to flesh out the enemy/mission, was extremely contrived. I get that the focus was on Maverick but this still felt a bit lazy.
3) Some of the dialog/acting from the new pilots was pretty bad."
8,TVJerry,"Jun 2, 2022","More than 30 years later, Tom Cruise returns as the daring, renegade aviator from his original hit. His character is sent to teach a group of young pilots who are charged with an especially challenging mission. If you remember the original, there are lots of parallel scenes and relationships in this one, including a brief appearance by Val Kilmer. Basically, this film boils down to macho posturing peppered with flight footage and moments of romance. While the plot is predictable at every turn, the solid performances and tight editing help make it appealing. However, it's the spectacular aerial scenes that makes the movie memorable. It's a solid popcorn flick that's an appropriate follow up."
10,rattley,"Jun 2, 2022","Outstanding. And I don’t write that lightly. This film really delivers. I wanted to watch it again immediately. Solid but simple story line.
Great cast. Amazing flight sequences. Action.  Humour. Sadness. Love. Just a great blockbuster movie . To be honest, I’ve missed this sort of cinematic experience. This all being lead by the unbelievable , incredible Tom Cruise. Who truly puts himself on the line for the film goers. A true artist. One of the last real classic film stars. This film has all that you need. Will it win Oscars? Probably not. But will you get your money worth? Absolutely. In my humble opinion, This is such a better movie than the first, even though I still love that movie. I was gripped within the first opening minutes. My heart did not stop beating at high rates in anticipation of every moment. I was not disappointed. It’s been a long long time since I’ve experienced that rush and enjoyment watching a film.  I recommend anyone to go see this film. You will not leave disappointed. ( I hope). ️️️️️"
8,digitalkoimoi,"Jun 2, 2022","What’s Good: It’s not just action and visually shocking stunts that overpower the narrative, but an emotional story and a touching conflict that manages to grab your attention.

What’s Bad: The women in this universe are strong but don’t get enough to do. They support the men and that cannot be the only thing they get to do.

Loo Break: Please no, Tom Cruise is returning after decades and you cannot really miss even a single scene. Plus it’s in theatres, there will be intermission in India at least.

Watch or Not?: Miles Teller in an interview told me there is almost no green screen involved, if you won’t acknowledge this effort, who will?

8,AJ_13,"Jun 1, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick gave me even more than I was expecting. A vibrant, immersive action film, beautifully shot and flawlessly crafted. It goes from less to more, hitting the high notes during action scenes and managing to get emotional. When it comes to performances, Miles Teller is great in it and the rest of the cast is fine. I don't have enough adjectives to describe my admiration for Tom Cruise."
9,alejandro970,"Jun 1, 2022","As incredible as it sounds, it has the charisma of the previous one, and increased, despite the 35-year gap between them. The flavor of nostalgia is always present, with a script with many surprises and action scenes that must be seen on a giant screen."
10,Wihglah,"Jun 1, 2022","This amazing sequel is an unapologetic homage to both the original and the US Navy. There are several call backs to the first movie and a great new storyline. The minor characters can be a little one dimensional, but there are twists and turns top the plot that I did not anticipate. Tom Cruise is still a proper movie star here, Miles Teller and Jennifer Connelly were also fantastic."
10,danielago,"Jun 1, 2022","Filme sensacional! Sequências de ação extremamente bem feitas e imersivas, acho que é o filme de combate aéreo mais imersivo que já vi. História bem envolvente também e te deixa tenso nas horas certas! Visual maravilhoso!"

9,HamishIII,"May 31, 2022",Excellent popcorn flick made for the fans.  Excellent characterization and Easter Eggs along with homages to the previous movie.  I saw the original in the theater and glad Tom held out for this to be in the theater and a must see on a big screen with great sound.  My kids also enjoyed the movie and one had only just seen Top Gun recently and the other not at all.  Glad there was no hidden agenda.  Great to see all the practical filming aspects vs green screen.   I highly recommend this.
10,Proko8,"May 31, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick is the best movie i have seen in years. 10/10 movie of the year, and its not even close.

7,mrc_brn,"May 31, 2022","In the moment, while watching, the scenes manage to exhilarate and evoke testosterone infused manly man feelings throughout. After the movie is done, and the story sinks in, one can only smirk at the absolute nonsense that you just swallowed, hook, line and sinker. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt and Superman in a flight suit, it should have been called Mission (Im)Possible 8. But the dog fight scenes and all. that. machismo. are fun to watch while it lasts.."
7,Mauro_Lanari,"May 31, 2022","(Mauro Lanari)
Sly had already tried it with the trilogy ""The Expendables"", an economic but not critical success: a dozen years ago the hangover of the planetary reviewers was aimed at crossmedialization (or globalization) and panned as ""nostalgia operation"" everything what was distant from the new trend. Instead Bruckheimer returns to produce not silly TV series but a blockbuster, calling back in their roles as film stars actors sold off to the fictions of the streaming platforms: Val Kilmer, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris. Not a masterpiece but not even the caricature of a blockbuster: fortunately it is not Bergman who plays chess with death, but it is the identical concept adapted for the masses (""Time is your worst enemy""). And it is also metacinematographic: the military mission to be accomplished is feasible only by downgrading the paraphernalia and relying on the additional capabilities of the human factor so as to circumvent the digital supertechnology set up to fight something that on paper should no longer exist. This reminds the historic lose wars because of an arsenal suitable for pitched battles and not for guerrilla warfare. Havin' learned the lesson, passed the period of famine, victory is guaranteed. Ps: just to be clear, I have no memory of a single frame of Tony Scott's film."

Um, it was thrilling, it really captivated you, um, it was also sad at some parts. Um, what else... Overall, it was very captivating, um, and a good watch, but I would reccomend watching the first one before watching this one so it makes sense, but you don't have to watch the last one because it explains some bits, but it does help dramatically if you um watch the last one. - Blake"
7,Schlafrockman,"May 30, 2022","It's a showcase of brilliance in every aspect of cinematography, definitely worth seeing... I quite liked how they put the emotional weight of the story into the relation with Goose Jr.  But on the other hand... it's just an action flick full of cliches, leaning toward sci-fi so, I cannot quite understand the overwhelming ratings."
0,Fearls1,"May 30, 2022","This movie is purely for movie theater profits. It will fade into obscurity before winter, as it has nothing the original brought to the screen. Music is terrible, the hero is completely unbelievable 60 year old man, that is somehow better than the best in the world cadets. Moral of this movie, is go see little Tom Cruise show you his degrading body. Disgusting."

10,cmhh,"May 29, 2022",Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick.
10,digbiggly,"May 29, 2022",The BEST movie in years!! I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about it! Congrats Tom and Paramount.
9,MovieWarfare,"May 29, 2022","Firstly, the flying sequences are breathtaking and this is all because they did it practically. This is especially noticeable in the final act which is one of the best I've seen in recent memory. Additionally, the music score by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga, Hans Zimmer, & Lorne Balfe is very good. I love how they incorporated those 80s tracks into the film while giving more modern and fitting music as well. Furthermore, their music score during the intense action scenes are well done and helps to make the scenes tenser.

Tom Cruise is still great as Maverick even after almost 30 years. He still embodies the character perfectly and does feel like a natural evolution of his character from the first film. I genuinely believe that this is what Maverick would be like in 30 years. Miles Teller is also great as Rooster, Goose's son, and he has great synergy with Tom Cruise in their scenes together. Jennifer Connelly plays the new love interest for Maverick, Penny, and she is also great in her role thanks to her great chemistry with Tom. Glen Powell plays the rival to Miles and he is very good at being this overly cocky, hateable guy. Likewise, Jon Hamm plays the commander that is antagonistic to Maverick and he also does a good job at being hateable as well. Val Kilmer is one of the few actors from the original to return and I was interested to see how they would handle his throat cancer situation in real life. Thankfully, this film handles it respectfully and probably results in one of the most emotional scenes in the film. The rest of the supporting cast, including those who play the recruits, all do a good job as well.

Moreover, the story itself is also surprisingly enjoyable. The first Top Gun was a cheesy action flick but this one is a very down to earth, character-driven story. Maverick is a lot wiser now thanks to the character arc he got from the first film when he was a student. However, now he has to be the teacher and this is a great antithesis to the story in the first film. The conflict between Maverick and Rooster is the heart and soul of this film. This family dynamic they have is the most engaging aspect of the story as Maverick now struggles with the possibility of letting the son of his once best friend die. Nevertheless, I do have some minor nitpicks with the film. I do find the dynamic of the recruits never does quite match the dynamic of the recruits from the first film. I never felt as strong of an attachment to the recruits and this is probably due to the film focusing on the teacher Maverick. There is also a romantic subplot with Maverick and Penny that just feels very superfluous. It never felt like the romance part was even connected to anything in the main plot. Heck, you could take this romance subplot and Penny out of the film and the main story is still the same. It just felt like the romance plot just took away screen time from the interesting stuff. I am also a little annoyed that there is no dialogue or line to explain why Maverick isn't with Charlie from the first film anymore. Especially, considering how relevant that character was in the first film.

Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is better than the first movie in almost every aspect. It has more amazing action sequences and a more interesting character-driven story. In a world where CGI seems to always be the go-to solution, we then get a rare movie like this where the majority is practical and it is all the better for it. This is not only a worthy sequel but also an amazing accomplishment in movies."
3,Kamiyou,"May 29, 2022","In the original Top Gun, Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell wasn't perfect. In this movie, he is.

This movie relentlessly builds the character up into an infallible, extremely boring superhero, who gets second chances for anything and everything. The new generation of pilots that should surpass and replace a man past his physical prime isn't even allowed to come close to him. Also, nepotism is OK when it benefits Maverick, for some reason.

The original movie, so often dismissed as ""dumb Reaganite bombast"", had characters who were at least human. Interesting at times. Definitely not fit for real military service, but good for a story. Top Gun Maverick is much sillier and less believable than its forebear."
10,VertEXTV,"May 29, 2022",One of the best movies ive ever seen! I feel like the sequel is way better than the original purly because of the way the filmed it and how the stunts were almost all real.

10,andrebolivar,"May 29, 2022","Um filme que supera em todos os aspectos seu antecessor. Não perde (tanto) tempo com romance fajuto e desenvolve muito bem os personagens.  Seu inimigo e objetivo fica claro bem do início e os acontecimentos se encaixam perfeitamente. Algumas coincidências amarradas pelo roteiro, mas foram uma solução compreensível para fecharem todos os arcos da história sem forçar demais a barra.

Top Gun Maverick é sem sombra de dúvidas o filme que você vai querer ver no cinema. Valeu cada centavo! Recomendo."

8,skyhong2002,"May 29, 2022",This is an overwhelming masterpiece. For years it's scarce to see that a movie pushes so hard on a single character's narrative full of emotion and experience.
10,hhf2,"May 29, 2022","If you watched TopGun as a kid and loved it, this sequel will bring you to your knees with tears. It brought my entire cinema down in a rollercoaster of HOOOOLY **** and NOOOOO and HELLYEAHHHs. It’s that good. I’m not a Tom Cruise fan, actually the opposite. Have a hard separating his acting and his “religion”. But daaamn, that man brought his A game to this one. Easily the best flick 2022 so far (guess it should earn “best late movie of 2020"
9,Rebecca31,"May 29, 2022","Alright folks, strap yourselves in for one of the most anticipated movies of the year, the Navy’s top aviators are finally back. After over thirty years, Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) has been called back into service. Join Cruise and all the other top pilots in their most dangerous mission yet, only this time without the cheesy 80s soundtrack. Maverick finds himself in the unlikely position as a teacher to the best of the best Top Gun graduates for a confidential and highly dangerous mission in “insert generic country here.” Not only is Maverick faced with the difficult task of training these pilots for a mission “the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen” but one of the recruits is Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller) aka “Rooster” aka the son of “Goose”.

Well I know the original Top Gun has a massive fanbase, who I can only imagine love it so much due to nostalgia because if like me you recently watched it, I think we all realise it has not aged well at all. Top Gun: Maverick has taken the franchise to a whole new level, very much like the Mission Impossible movies, it’s kicked it into a new gear and is all about the action. The flight sequences are an exhilarating thrill ride you won’t want to miss. Adrenaline fuelled, gripping and so well filmed that you will feel like you’re sitting in the jets themselves. Visually epic, and exceeds expectations. It’s not necessary to see the original Top Gun beforehand but it does help. And although Top Gun: Maverick isn’t as cheesy as the first one, it does have enough cringey dialogue to remind you that you are in fact watching a Top Gun movie.

There’s also a surprising emotional element throughout that I definitely wasn’t expecting, and the decision to bring back Val Kilmer as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky was handled perfectly. Miles Teller was absolutely perfect casting for Lt. Nick Bradshaw’s son. It’s been a while since I’ve seen Teller in anything as good as Whiplash and he’s here now reminding us all of how good an actor he really is. Top Gun: Maverick has improved on the original in every way and caters towards both new and old fans of Top Gun.

I was “lucky” enough to be sitting right next to three of Tom Cruise’s biggest fans. They might have been enjoying it more than everyone else in the cinema combined judging by their whooping, clapping and the fact that they were practically wetting themselves with anticipation any time Cruise was onscreen or there was any sort of reference made to the original Top Gun. These ultra-fanboys loved every minute of it so Top Gun fans I can promise you’ll absolutely adore this sequel.

Look many of you know that I’m not the biggest Tom Cruise fan at all but when he’s delivering on the action it’s honestly a terrific experience to see on the big screen in a cinema. He may not be Hollywood’s greatest actor but he’s got one setting that he does better than anyone, and that setting is action man. Despite being nearly sixty he does not shy away from the stunts and in a time where cinemas are struggling I can tell you that Top Gun: Maverick is made for the big screen so be sure you see it on the biggest screen possible and enjoy. Highly recommended and a must see for all the Top Gun fans."

9,kevscorner,"May 28, 2022",A great summertime movie. I'm surprised Tom Cruise can pull it off still after 36 years. The supporting cast did a great job as well.
10,Eissa1996,"May 28, 2022","This movie feels like the end and the beginning at the same time oh my gooooood what an experience, was on the edge of seat the whole time. Tom cruise is truly the last real movie star. An epic movie and one hell of an experience."
7,Stream2BigScree,"May 28, 2022","Hey, Streamers, let's fly off into the Danger Zone. Yes, it's Top Gun: Maverick time. The sequel you have been waiting almost 40 years for, which was supposed to come out 2 years ago, is finally here. Now, I have never seen the original film, but I was keen to see what all the hype around this sequel was about. Tom Cruise has made good choices over the years and he's always going full tilt in these action roles, so I didn't expect for this to disappoint. Here's how it goes.

Even though Top Gun: Maverick is a present-day sequel to the original Top Gun (1986), the movie really leans into that old-fashioned, 1980's action film vibe. Also, there is a big spoiler from the original film that is central to the story of this sequel - Maverick's wingman, Goose, died. Here, Goose's son, Rooster (Miles Teller), is one of the elite Navy aviators, who Maverick (Tom Cruise) is tasked with training for what's considered an important but impossible mission. There is tension between Maverick and Rooster because of their fraught history. There is tension between Maverick and his superiors because he is notorious for going rogue. Nevertheless, Maverick is the best and the mission requires the best. High-flying hijnks ensue.

Top Gun: Maverick is the kind of movie that begs to be seen on a big screen. In my opinion, the story is not really great or innovative, so the actions sequences, stunts and camera work have to justify the price of admission. Luckily, they very much do. The aerial shots and all of the fighter jets flying have to be seen on a big screen to truly be appreciated. The rumble of the jets and the perceived danger add to the tension that builds up through the movie and explodes in the final sequences. While there is an attempt to build an emotional core to the film by focusing on Maverick and Rooster's relationship and also a slight love interest on the side, those relationships barely register and seem almost superfluous. Honestly, they could've cut the love story and the film would have been the same but 10-15 minutes shorter - that would have given them the ability to cultivate the Maverick and Rooster relationship, which would have been more impactful.

Some of this movie is so retro as to be kind of corny. Glen Powell plays Hangman. He's one of the **** aviators in the Top Gun program. Powell plays it like the quintessential 1980's movie villain, which was groan-inducing at times, but some may love it. Tom Cruise is at his Tom-Cruise-iest, which isn't a bad thing. Movies need stars and Tom Cruise is still a movie star. He still has the charm to pull off Maverick's character. As the movie leans into the nostalgia, Tom Cruise makes it worthy of being on a big screen. This movie desperately needs that.

Nevertheless, what was presented was certainly entertaining. There will be times when the flying will have you on the edge of your seat. That's why a movie like this is made. In that way, it is quite successful.

Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick is tailor-made to be seen in a movie theater. The feats of stunts and action are worthy of the big screen. There are times when you may be on the edge of your seat. Although the story is a bit lacking, the rest of the movie makes up for it and the 2-hour runtime flies by in a *wink*. Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this spectacle on a big screen."
10,Kauanydiniz0,"May 28, 2022",Filme incrível
10,Lumdog,"May 28, 2022","This is a true action blockbuster that is so rare these days. The big messy CGI set pieces that are all too common today have desensitised and bored audiences to what real action can be. Audiences are screaming for action that is shot practically and real, visceral, and heart pumping. Top Gun: Maverick exceeds the first one in every way. This is how you make a perfect sequel - reinvigorating the franchise whilst injecting just enough nostalgia and cheesiness to pay homage to the original. Credit to Tom Cruise for making the film happen, and dedicating himself to performing these stunts practically. Super fun and an incredible watch!"
10,Stercrazy,"May 28, 2022","An excellent sequel to a classic. Full of the franchise's signature high octane scenes, the movie nevertheless manages to have many emotional and poignant scenes, especially between Maverick and Rooster. The movie also has an incredibly touching moment paying tribute to Val Kilmer that had everyone in the theater with me tearing up. I definitely recommend it."
8,Dee-Jay_Deli,"May 28, 2022","This is good. Mostly thanks to the unique air-combat action that is thrilling to watch. Not to say the human drama doesn't do its job, but it clearly isn't the priority. The movie does build on the original's characters and events a little more than I expected. It's easy to gripe about too many side-characters and how a little more focus on the core characters and relationships would have given it more emotional punch, but that's only a minor issue. Overall, Top Gun Maverick is an absolutely thrilling experience, especially on a large screen and the movie (literally) takes off."
10,Misant,"May 28, 2022","This Movie made me smile so often it was really a pleasure to watch.

5,arrivist,"May 28, 2022","Saw this in 4DX. The scenes in the air are are brilliant. Its so great they shot it in-camera and not like a Marvel CGI video game. It is worth watching the film just for the spectacular aerial sequences. Everything else is a bit ridiculous. The dialogue could have been written by a 15-year-old who had recently watched the original film. Close up's Jennifer Connelly's over-smoothed face and distant delivery garnered the loudest laughs from the audience. The overall message of the film is: Tom Cruise is the saviour of the universe, kneel before Tom, then go pay to see another Mission Impossible."
9,tbhockey,"May 28, 2022","It's a good movie overall, but the 3rd act is utterly breathtaking in every way and carries it several steps up."
10,marco34la,"May 28, 2022","It's very rare for any movie to be worthy of a rating of 10. For an action drama sequel -- this was a 10. It hits all the right notes -- action, suspense, drama, nostalgia, love --
and the story is a good one. It's a fun ride. Good way to kick off summer. Bravo to Cruise and team for making a good movie at a time when most everything else is crap."
9,ValBal,"May 27, 2022","Cruise control baby! I think this film is best described as the movie that was made in the 80s and I mean it in the best way possible. Apart from technology that was used to achieve beautiful shots of fighter planes action this film is a classic heroism tale. It's full of heart, badass moments, character drama and romance that's perhaps the only unnecessary part of the film."
9,Compi24,"May 27, 2022","Honestly, the hype this had coming out of Cannes had me a bit worried. If even that film festival's occasionally-fussy audience members managed to bestow this with near-universal acclaim, then that's a lot of damn pressure on me to like this thing too. Christ alive did I nothing to worry about. Not only is ""Top Gun: Maverick"" at least a worthy companion piece to the seminal 80's classic, it's a disarmingly superior film and quite possibly one of the best sequels to a movie that's about as much of a cultural fixture as movies can get. Joseph Kosinski, Tom Cruise and the screenwriting and stunt teams needs to take a victory lap on this one. Potent emotionality, eminent likability on the part of Cruise and ripping soundtrack aside, the thing I loved the most about this one is how much the stakes and circumstances are ramped up this time around. I remember the set pieces in the original Tony Scott film being engaging and entertaining, but never quite as intense and menacing as they're presented here. There's almost a point in the film where you as an audience member are dreading the moment where this final mission has to take place. The action also scales in such a satisfying way throughout the course of the film, with the finale honestly constituting one of the best action sequences I've seen in a movie in a very, very long time. Doubtful that any summer movie's going to top this in the coming months. Completely floored with how much I absolutely loved nearly every minute of this."
10,Fb29,"May 27, 2022","Everything I wanted and more. I knew I was going to see this movie in theatres, but it was spur of the moment to see it tonight. I’m so glad I did. I intend to see it again in IMAX.

6,Glic2003,"May 27, 2022","A solid follow up to the original but lacks the charisma of the original cast, and while the aviation scenes are spectacular, everything on the ground kind of drags."
10,TheRandomCat,"May 27, 2022","I am a huge fan of the original, which hit theaters when I was 8. This sequel was everything I could have hoped for - and then some. Not only was reverence and homage paid to the story of the original movie, but the sequel also had its own unique narrative and deeper themes than just the cinematic spectacle of the aerial action. I had tears in so many moments while my heart was going at Mach speeds and pulling massive Gs. The work in the planes was also real and that meant a lot. See it on as big a screen as you can."

8,CalvinCrack,"May 27, 2022","Top Gun 2 delivers that 80s cheese you want with a striking coat of modern paint.  While I wasn’t moved by the film’s paint-by-number emotional subplots, they were in service of a well rounded story that pays off marvelously in its final stretch.  The last 30 minutes of this film are among the best stretches of any action film I’ve seen.  It becomes a full on roller coaster that deserves to be seen in IMAX."
10,mikeydee36,"May 27, 2022","A love-letter to the soon becoming past-era of manned military aviation, and a homage to the original, that somehow manages to better it in almost every way.

The adrenaline ride hits hard about midway through and continues to pump to an ending that pays tribute to its predecessor, be prepared to be on the edge of your seat from the sheer photographic brilliance and Tom's incredibly realistic portrail of G-forces in every aerial action shot.

No wonder Paramount held onto this for so long, they knew they had fire in their hands and I'm sure they'll milk it for what it's worth!"
10,PacMacMan,"May 27, 2022",Excellent movie! It honored the work of Tony Scott and even made me remember the good movies of the 80's and 90's.
8,ty92,"May 27, 2022",This movie was solid overall with a good opening and a great ending with a bunch of filler in the middle that hurt the pacing of the movie. All the action scenes are incredible. The romance between Maverick and the bartender didn't work for me at all and all those scenes were bad. Maverick trains all these top gun fighters for a mission that's like something from Ace Combat 7. Ice man was in this too and there's some emotional scenes with him. Movie could have been amazing but it was just missing something in the middle that could have made it a little more interesting or entertaining. Honestly the middle of this movie dragged. If you like the romance stuff maybe you disagree but it didn't work for me. Also Goose's son is in this movie as a fighter pilot and there's a storyline involving him in Maverick that is interesting and it really works well. Some of this movie is incredible and better than the original. But I think in the original the romance worked more. In this one it didn't at all maybe because Tom Cruise is older and the actress playing the bartender is not that good looking and old
10,cowboyjon,"May 27, 2022",Best film I've seen in years and the best cinema experience I've had since The Dark Knight.

Don't sell short on Tom Cruise getting an Oscar nomination for this.  He pulled everything together very nicely.  The story is superficial, non-stop fun.  It's worth seeing."
9,lookash,"May 27, 2022","I saw the original when I was 4 years old back in 1986. I cried through the whole opening scene of Maverick. Fast, loud and unapologetic. Pure visual poetry. A true and worthy sequel."
5,azzamann79,"May 27, 2022",I'm not sure what movie others were watching but this is not even close to bettering the original. It lacks the soul of the original. From the  one liners that people still remember today the cast of over the top egotistical characters who are larger than life. The great soundtrack that strikes up at the right time. This movie has none of it. It try's to ride on the coat tails of nostalgia and falls flat. It won't take your breath away. Infact if anything it's lost that loving feeling.
10,LuissDt,"May 27, 2022","It's time to fly with Tom Cruise in Top Gun Maverick, an exciting sequel full of great joy, it seems that everything indicates that there is already a movie that flies to the OSCARS 2023."
10,SXTREME,"May 27, 2022","Excellent movie overall, great story, great acting. It is the first time we see actors flying those amazing machines and it is certainly an amazing experience."
8,JLuis_001,"May 27, 2022","Many times the entertainment that doesn't seek to be complicated tends to be very relaxed and ends up being rather poor and, of course, completely forgettable.
Top Gun: Maverick falls into the category of pure entertainment, but it's one that makes the case of how to do it the right way. The story may seem simple yes, I'll give you that, but its strength is the action sequences and the film doesn't lie about it and gives it to you in abundance. Everything that happens with jets in this film is spectacular, especially that beautiful opening sequence with Maverick piloting that hypersonic plane. Does it rely on nostalgia? Of course, especially with that little Val Kilmer appearance, but it never feels like a gratuitous resource within the story. After all the movie makes it clear that it's a sequel, but it's not 100% vital for you to have seen the original.
And even if you can question how necessary this sequel was after 36 years, this story proves its functionality in the blockbuster branch that should continue to invest in films like this one. Yes, it's a sequel and stars an ultra-famous name, but there's life for blockbusters outside of superheroes.
Of course, that remains to be seen at the box office, after all, even with inflation, the original film cost just over $30 million, Top Gun: Maverick, not counting marketing, cost over $150 million.

It sounds repetitive and perhaps for people who prefer streaming they won't even flinch, but as Cruise said it and as he fought for it, films like these are the ones that remind us why the theatrical experience will never be matched. Go see it, and have a good time."

9,Markini,"May 27, 2022",Top Gun: Maverick is as good if not better than the original movie from the 80s. The first and third acts keep in glued to the screen in anticipation to what will happen next. The nostalgia music sounds just as good 30 years later. All actors from Tom Cruise to the younger crew do an exceptional job in their acting. The real jet fighter scenes really encapsulate the jaw dropping moments during several parts in the film. The revamped volleyball scene does not disappoint either. And the film ending with Gaga's epic ballad really seals the deal.
8,bertobellamy,"May 27, 2022","If 'Top Gun' is about Maverick coming into terms with his sexuality — as Tarantino explained in that hilarious video — then 'Top Gun Maverick' is about Tom Cruise saving the cinematic experience. When Ed Harris' character tells Maverick that ""his kind it's headed for extinction"", Maverick's ""But not today, sir"" is Tom Cruise's war declaration to streaming services. As long as he's alive, no film of his will debut on any platform. Even if you hate the guy, you gotta praise his commitment to the good old habit of going to the cinema."

The military hardware was great to see in motion and everything just ""felt"" right with a lot of throwbacks to the earlier film as well as this one forging its own path.  Fun, poignant and great action. A review score seems almost arbitrary as I'll buy this on 4 k when released. So if you liked the first Top Gun you'll like this one.  9.9/10. Go see it then go and buy it on your favourite format when it's released. 25/5/2022."
10,KodiakB,"May 27, 2022","I had absolutely 0 expectations coming to this movie - I didn’t really know what it is going to be about and neither did I see the previous movie. Nevertheless, I was absolutely stunned by an amalgamation of visual, auditory and 4D experience of the movie, it really drove my adrenaline up. But what was more surprising is how human the movie is - it conveys emotions, hopes, ups and downs so good that it’s not possible not to care about every single character in the movie. Moreover, even though I didn’t see the first movie, I still got a great sense of nostalgia that is done just right to bring context to the movie, not just cash on peoples memories. All in all, I’m just mesmerized by it and might go for the 2nd run."

10,BradMorgan,"May 27, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick is one of the most gripping action movies I've ever seen. Moments that you are literally on the edge of your seat don't happen often anymore. Yet this film manages to amaze in 2022 with breathtaking shots in which you almost feel the g-forces, a fantastic soundtrack and a story that has taken the time to tell it at the right pace. This film is one to remember!"

9,joyal,"May 27, 2022","Outstanding .If you didn't see the first part, see it first before experiencing this one ,this part just does what a sequel should do - which in this case means Doubling down on the Incredible Visuals ,Thrills and Emotions that made the topgun so much Fun!

And you just can watch it for one man the maverick himself TomCruise ,he is keep finding ways to entertain to the highest level and this role he just done it with heartwarming emotions !

Excellent making and directions and background score is perfect to the story pacing and all cast done terrific job !!"
10,Panchogul,"May 27, 2022","TG: Maverick es sencillamente impresionante, si te gustó la original, esta te va a encantar. Tenemos a un Tom Cruise entregado al máximo, es sin duda el mejor actor para este tipo de películas sin ser encasillado ni estereotipado. Los efectos especiales son una bestialidad, pero el sonido juega un papel muchísimo mayor, te envuelve y te atrapa de primera, por lo que si quieren pasarla en grande, veanla en el cine, en la mejor sala y butaca posible y no se arrepentirán.

Solo tengo un pequeño pero y es que pareciera que el personaje de Charlie nunca existió, porque no es mencionada ni por accidente, sin embargo, su total ausencia es imperceptible.

Una secuela colosal y brutal sin necesidad de minimizar a la original."

8,43in2014,"May 27, 2022","The short review: This has the best jet fighter action scenes in a film, EVER. The human drama part, however, falls a bit short. Related media: I have seen the original Top Gun film on TV numerous times. That film likely had the best jet fighter action scenes in a film back then too, and the human drama part also fell a bit short back then too.


Positives:


1) All the jet fighter scenes are genuinely, top of the class! 2) The sound effects and the special effects are really top notch!


3) The excuse used to feature the F-14 fighter in the film in a major way, when no F-14 is allowed to fly anymore, in the military or by the public, is CLEVER.


Negatives: 1) (This is hinted at in the trailer, so it’s not spoiler.) It has been some 35 years since the events in the original film. Surely the grief over the death of Goose should be over by now? This part is rather unrealistic. I know there’s more to it, but still…


2) The past relationship between Maverick and new flame was hinted at, but not covered much in this film. This coincided with a slow part of the film, thus making this part feel poor.


3) The original film had two great original songs. The songs in this film are not great.



4) (This is hinted at in the trailer, so it’s not a spoiler.) The top enemy fighter plane is obviously the Russian Su-57 (Felon), yet the film makes all attempts to call it the ‘fifth generation fighter’ rather than its real name, all the time, such that the film distributor can sell the film to the Russian market. That’s silly! Considering the banning of such sales following the Russo-Ukrainian war, that’s all for nought! Pilots would not use so many words to describe the fighter. As with the original Top Gun film, where the enemy fighter was given the fictitious name, Mig-28, here the fighter should also had been given a fictitious name, like ‘Firefox’.


Children: Excellent.


Teens: Excellent.


Young adults: Excellent.


Medium-age adults: Excellent


Older adults: Good.                    My rating: 4/5 (no half scores). Definitely watch it in the cinema."
