But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie?

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now.",708,1135,0.006715022272291788,0.33750578288748395,53

This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.

Joshpeh S,10.0,2025-02-25,"もちろんです！以下に『トップガン マーヴェリック』のプロフェッショナルな日本語レビューをお届けします。

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,8.0,2025-01-12,"Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

Joshpeh S,10.0,2025-02-25,"もちろんです！以下に『トップガン マーヴェリック』のプロフェッショナルな日本語レビューをお届けします。

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,8.0,2025-01-12,"Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

Ryan N,10.0,2025-07-05,"This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now.",708,1135,0.006715022272291788,0.33750578288748395,53

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,8.0,2025-01-12,"Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

Joshpeh S,10.0,2025-02-25,"もちろんです！以下に『トップガン マーヴェリック』のプロフェッショナルな日本語レビューをお届けします。

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,8.0,2025-01-12,"Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Iain D,1.0,2024-12-27,"Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful.

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.

Lore O,2.0,2025-07-08,Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell.

But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie?

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now.",708,1135,0.006715022272291788,0.33750578288748395,53

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films.

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

David D,7.0,2024-07-11,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.,395,1065,0.005016247391124494,0.4003334932404681,27

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

David D,7.0,2024-07-11,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,8.0,2025-01-12,"Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。",182,827,0.001,1.0,1

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

David D,7.0,2024-07-11,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit.

But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie?

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now.",708,1135,0.006715022272291788,0.33750578288748395,53

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun.",387,877,0.00472044221455371,0.3403551482756148,24

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.

So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

David D,7.0,2024-07-11,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films.

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended.",978,726,0.006801237646602335,0.4558938308402799,56

Neel B,10.0,2024-01-29,"I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production.",916,612,0.0063266887999564635,0.33992943671737597,47

The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission.

It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name.",635,597,0.005082817820655961,0.3596189053455995,28

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

David D,7.0,2024-07-11,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit.

Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46
Lore O,2.0,2025-07-08,Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell.

But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie?

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now.",708,1135,0.006715022272291788,0.33750578288748395,53

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.

So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit.

Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

Michael S.,4.0,2025-07-09,"“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46
Lore O,2.0,2025-07-08,Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original.

But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original.

His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now.",708,1135,0.006715022272291788,0.33750578288748395,53

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

David D,7.0,2024-07-11,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit.

On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name.",635,597,0.005082817820655961,0.3596189053455995,28

Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked.",522,1139,0.006455650601245582,0.3064739021068843,46

The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks.

Joshpeh S,10.0,2025-02-25,"もちろんです！以下に『トップガン マーヴェリック』のプロフェッショナルな日本語レビューをお届けします。

---

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,8.0,2025-01-12,"Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10",692,961,0.006183069103498129,0.34482393876276124,42

Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!

The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.",862,776,0.006634590427718175,0.34786980208111973,50

David C,10.0,2024-06-08,"A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film.

Stan K,10.0,2024-06-08,"I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Test T,9.0,2024-05-22,"I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.

Neel B,10.0,2024-01-29,"I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production.",916,612,0.0063266887999564635,0.33992943671737597,47

The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission.

Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least.

Firstly, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. The stunning aerial footage of fighter planes soaring through the sky is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the sound effects will have you feeling like you're right in the middle of the action.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

unknown,10.0,2023-09-17,Didn’t think it would be possible to make a good sequel to the first. I was wrong. Just enough tie in to the original and yet still it’s own movie. A level of predictability is present. If this is a major issue you should probably choose another genre.,252,478,0.0037201584531114636,0.33525406478126707,15
Cali T,10.0,2023-09-14,"Disney and hollywood needs to take some notes. Reviving/continuing old movies means you need to reference and nod to the classics before it, which TG:Mav did and continued to extend the story. The story was smart not to mix politics (didn't mention where the enemies are from). That's why the film did extremely well and got paid billions. Pay the fan's service, and they'll pay you in box office sales. Simple math.",416,475,0.003766733420544421,0.38102607972326574,15
