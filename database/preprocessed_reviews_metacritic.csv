7,drqshadow,"Oct 2, 2024","Given the influence of rose-tinted nostalgia and the remarkable staying power of the original, Tom Cruise and company could be forgiven for just running everything back and cashing it in for the Top Gun sequel. And, as far as the plot is concerned, that’s pretty much what they’ve done. Sure, we’ll see a few mild distinctions, plus a shift in perspective (Cruise certainly isn’t going to play a student pilot, nor is he apt to give up that top billing), but the bones are essentially the same. Cocky kids in an elite dogfight academy are ordered to set aside their differences and accomplish an impossible mission in hostile airspace. Adrenaline, testosterone and pheromones run wild. We even get a reprisal of the YouTube-famous beach volleyball scene. It’s a fitting tribute and a worthy successor, modernized to suit today’s high-end home theater equipment, but not half as gloriously ‘80s-tastic as the first film.

Where Maverick really soars (if you’ll pardon the awful pun) is in a technical sense. This was evidently an area of special concern for the filmmakers, and they deserve special credit for the accomplishment. All that work to embed an array of super-resolution cameras into the pilot’s seat has paid off: this is a major level-up moment, on par with the very best IMAX showpieces. Paired with a persistent soundtrack of strained grunts and rapid breathing, the footage does a fantastic job of conveying the intense physical effort that’s required to maintain control of a fighter jet, while also portraying the stunning vistas and dizzying speeds of afterburner combat. More than just special effects for a film, Maverick’s vision of airborne cinema borders on a true life experience. As a film, it’s a light-hearted flex of the bicep, designed to pluck memory threads and evoke warm feelings established by the original. Worthwhile, especially for long-term fans, but not particularly special. The cockpit scenes, though, especially that blood-rushing one-cut takeoff from the aircraft carrier, will stick with me for a long while.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272978562202919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640231085460486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24363193649698908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18780951744896998,0.0,0.0,0.20159359272223892,0.0,0.17576797114349701,0.0,0.0,0.20393133761462987,0.35788074723534097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224958447266214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24895711372971813,0.0,0.0,0.39446949352962246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2605869464399621,0.19136034652153044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1719327835760367,0.0,0.24895711372971813,0.0,0.17711775802911542,0.0,0.0,0.15814870830276778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15209743718401086,0.0,0.0,0.1340428697783835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19136034652153044,0.0,0.0,0.12011971090743138,0.12633953896037123,0.1672545079971461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

10,przybylop,"May 29, 2024","This is one of the rare perfect movies I've seen. It's not overwhelmingly profound or epic, but every line of dialogue, every casting choice, and every shot serves their purpose perfectly. No wasted movements or scenes. It can be used to teach ""How to build a satisfying blockbuster"" class for years to come. It goes big, it gets weighty enough with existential issues, and it has enough twist and turns to make you question if the aging protagonist is supposed to survive this. 

Cruise is at his best as the equal parts vulnerable and cocky Maverick. His instant chemistry with Connelly makes you believe the latter was really in the original/first Top Gun. Supporting roles are hit with expert precision.

Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. It reaches all of its goals (action, star-driven, thoughtful, nostalgic, fun, suspense) effortlessly.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14592852875951517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599695335590172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24529351450336215,0.23820159546106837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15308068964672336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24529351450336215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087970358415525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3072511915995342,0.19012207446157678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21762428302951742,0.25333366918964983,0.32746798344687583,0.0,0.0,0.17914418012185299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15642664590762292,0.22432136971295671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19873842224313945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19113405994632657,0.0,0.18347782825451625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21018127425213776,0.24283555204154206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19990761857168907

10,extrashotlatte,"Jun 11, 2023","For a sequel no one knew they wanted, asked for, or expected, Top Gun: Maverick was one of the best (if not the best) film of 2022, which reminds us why Tom Cruise is one of the few legitimate superstars of our time.

By now most people would have seen this film, which takes place 30 years after the events of the first Top Gun. Tom Cruise steps into this role effortlessly, and supported by a cast which is both cliché and endearing. Arrogant guy, chip on shoulder guy, takes-no-crap girl, goofy/nervous guy… but before you can start an eye roll, you find yourself rooting for these characters.

Cinematography, visual effects, practical effects all marry with such precision the resulting visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. The training sequence through the simulated route and dog fights give us a glimpse of what is to come. Combine this scintillating action with high stakes, impeccable acting and an absolute-gut punch of nostalgia, this film warrants multiple viewings. The sound design is remarkable. Both at the cinema and at home with a Dolby Atmos capable sound system, this film roars to life from all around you, and even overhead. If you caught this film in 4D – how good was it!

This film feels like the old Hollywood blockbusters where there’s a goal with some history/character arc, and the goal is ultimately achieved with struggle and growth along the way. Dialogue and chemistry between characters feels natural and real, which ground the otherwise the over-the-top plot.

Top Gun: Maverick is simple storytelling that doesn’t deconstruct established characters or lore, and that allows newcomers to earn their place.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523897755269838,0.07893325581189102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17305616964495654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541262467932723,0.0,0.13007323757927028,0.34571693265809517,0.1114913154904857,0.1326801270038105,0.0,0.0,0.16560376971466778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326801270038105,0.0,0.27405815005323625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48652407153696026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794585693151383,0.0,0.0,0.2492898795512562,0.2056754010546346,0.12884408298472014,0.0,0.0,0.09600736894288406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1771285870373783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11686775349372013,0.13551397714558852,0.0,0.0,0.1203921326356751,0.0,0.11686775349372013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09924380432348885,0.09111286827926582,0.0,0.27102795429117704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10394183104847979,0.16329777802798504,0.17175337697247406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144541508746082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10813073584445487

2,Tiger_X,"Jun 1, 2023","Top Gun peaks in the very first scene wherein Maverick takes a cutting edge jet/spaceship to record breaking speed. We never see this awesome jet again or the intensity of this scene repeated. The entire rest of the movie features slow outdated airplanes in an attempt to save money and help the studio cash-in on nostalgia.

The supporting cast is almost as listless as Iceman's cameo. They rehash the entire Goose story in a really weird way with his son, Rooster! Finally, they tack on a new Maverick romance for no apparent reason (but to include the ""Labyrinth girl"") that is cringe and goes nowhere. Every single joke falls flat and the dog fights are not as realistic as the first movie.

7,tonyGreen,"Mar 11, 2023","The plot and cast of characters is a almost a beat-for-beat remake of the first film in parts. There is completely superfluous romance, unlike in the first film where it was a key plot point.
This film definitely caters to in a large part to the audience of the 1985 film 'Top Gun'. The score reuses a lot of the original film's score, definitely a lot of nostalgia smuggled in. Some of this comes across as slightly ludicrous. For example Iceman, sorry *Hangman*, is a big fan of Foghat and their 1975 hit ""Slow Ride"".

But the film stands out for it's great aerial action sequences, they really are spectacular, and the conflict and pressure around those really lifts the sense of peril for the characters.

The (unidentified) foreign nuclear program is destroyed, American Exceptionlism triumphs against the odds, A shining city on the hill etc. Good fun, especially the second reel.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780117992075453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16439551161974753,0.0,0.1553908114448915,0.0,0.0,0.285570583946884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254963743999513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16274818719997566,0.0,0.0,0.602821051364717,0.0,0.0,0.1399356016458735,0.0984520624913193,0.09878148345960149,0.0,0.10295974791883492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310781622889783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14480340470957553,0.0,0.10483700939672531,0.0,0.29834047775769607,0.0,0.0,0.2663886541746663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15406761603293034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

To suggest there is no longer any need for even the smallest amount of context for who the bad guy is suggests this is really just about American Exceptionalism. ""It's right when we do it!"". The entire story pretext centres around murdering scientists, despite the movie not being about anything more than showboating airplanes. Maverick is a shallow, shallow character we never needed to revisit. This needs literally 10 more minutes in the writing room to make sense. The action sequences were well shot but so dumb, especially the Mach 10 sequence at the start where the movie jumped the shark right away.

8,AnActorExplains,"Jan 5, 2023","There is very little to be said about Top Gun: Maverick; that’s because it’s as close to flawless as a Hollywood production can get: Exhilarating cinematography, excellent audio both in fore and in background, premiere acting, a vibrant palette of colors in varied locations, and, most importantly, impeccable writing the likes of which we rarely see in this soulless, sellout era of film and television.

This movie has an incredibly diverse cast, with all the accompanying bells and whistles, and without any of the conceited, self-serving pretense of modern woke culture.  Top Gun: Maverick presents the argument that any man, woman or person of color is capable of excellence without sacrificing plot, contriving script, or assassinating character. It does so without any need to present the female in the guise of a male in order to elevate her, and without the need to crucify the male lead in order to satisfy a resentful audience.                                                                                                                                                                             What is most admirable about this movie is how it delivers on incredibly human themes that are vital, now more than ever before, to our current culture. Screen writers Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie seamlessly present extremely important themes such as selflessness, confidence, how to take a woman’s breath away, and how to create enduring friendships forged in competition. It even dares to present Commander “Iceman” Kazansky in a rather female light, as a patient, supportive, and compassionate authority. Take that, intersectionality! Family members of the enlisted will appreciate how director Joseph Kosinski does his very best to relay the incredible depth of feeling and emotion that is saying goodbye to a loved one that is headed into battle. All of this while developing a flawed protagonist who struggles to overcome his demons and deliver the best man he can be.

Yeah the plot was fairly simple. A do or die seemingly suicide mission against a high tech generic bad guy faction.

10,valrond,"Nov 22, 2022","This movie is not perfect. No one is. But I'm giving it a 10. Why?. It's very good. It's better than the original Top Gun, it's well paced, it has likable characters, the story is simple (it's the death star trench basically), but a good movie doesn't need a complicated story.
The flight scenes are great. Probably the best ever in a movie. It uses quite a bit of nostalgia without abusing it.
But above all, this movie is very entertaining, as it should be. And it makes you feel GOOD when you watch it.

5,Miclazz,"Oct 11, 2022","I do not think this movie surpasses the original. It has no originality and will not to capture the imagination of a new generation. I do not think there will be any fun moments emulated and cemented into pop culture like the original had. In fact all those moments are simply recreated in the new movie.

The script and story is sub-par (no memorable lines) and I didn't feel any emotion for the characters. One area where they seemed to spend a lot of time and money is in the aerial cinematography and actually flying the actors while being filmed, and all you see as far as online reviews go is real-world pilots being asked to rate the flight scenes on their realism. Ok, great. But that doesn't for a good film make! I just wouldn't care to watch it again. I feels like Top Gun original meets ""Iron Eagle"" (from a story and acting perspective) + ""Star Wars IV"" (for how they essentially copied the destruction of the Death Star scene as the finale and highlight to the action).

There was no magic or chemistry between the actors, nor the intensity of the scenes like the original.
The music is recreated to a large degree and that's ok, but I'll take the grainy and raw cinematography of the original with it's creative use of scoring and editing and close up shots over this remake any day.

It is entertaining as a fun action movie, if you don't compare it to the Tony Scott original, ignore the cringeworthy premise of the ""mission"" they are training for and don't count the many scenes, shoe-horned into the movie, for the sake of nostalgia. Basically completely forgettable.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758254579521528,0.14737792348539225,0.25302096498539545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758254579521528,0.0,0.24772982445067152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028373344259682,0.0,0.12386491222533576,0.23216657862079115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028373344259682,0.0,0.07569993434247546,0.0,0.0,0.21087085461503052,0.07417937362607215,0.07442757808688394,0.0,0.077575719756921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07899015513834881,0.2688860327987378,0.0,0.0,0.11708025985992394,0.0,0.0,0.10989288799636537,0.0,0.0,0.1214312234955793,0.1928249602262366,0.0,0.12262372447847283,0.0,0.23835595934580753,0.1091031065116186,0.0,0.4739409308300929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091031065116186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28954866914998645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17684075554224518,0.0,0.2341605197198479,0.09703597720396266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09175575992338969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

9,evilspeculator,"Sep 13, 2022","Amazing piece of cinema. Tremendous camera work.

They opted not to green screen the action just because it was hard to shoot paid off. You can almost see the green screen in most of today's movies because the directors, actors, and audience have gotten lazy. This movie finally breaks that expectation and returns you to a more believable experience.

The writing is excellent but not perfect. They could have explored the relationship between Maverick and Penny a bit more. Instead, it feels like an afterthought.

What's amazing is that they honored the original and improved on it.

10,bosrs1,"Sep 5, 2022","10/10 only because a higher rating isn’t possible. Easily on of the top 5 sequel movies of all time with Aliens, T2, Empire Strikes Back and Dark Knight and I’d say it’s the best movie of the last decade. It’s a nonstop literally edge of your seat thrill that has more heart than many movies thrown in for good measure that you will make you want to tear up at several points but also some well placed appropriate humor to balance it. Has just enough nostalgia to bring back good memories of the original, while working those references in organically so they don’t detract from the story this movie is telling. I’ve been caught saying this is what the Star Wars sequels should have been, a movie that introduces us to a new generation of interesting heroes who share the limelight, while still bringing us back an older, somewhat wiser, and more world weary version of our old heroes who are still very much the people we remember them to be from the old movie.

A sequel to a movie that no one was asking for, but it single-handedly revives the Western and American archetypes in a story that is universal and powerful.

Going forward, I will never mock Tom Cruise without also implying my own extreme reverence.

9,RoccoCille,"Sep 2, 2022","This movie is a modern rarity, because it is a completely old school classically produced film, which is real action and character focused above all else.  It pays respectful homage to the origin story, and beautifully interlinks many characters to the current one.  This is actually better than the original, it’s more subtle, but has some fantastic dynamics on so many different levels.  One of the best movies I have seen produced by Hollywood in years, without any gross politics trying to be shoved into it, just a pure story with realistic characters and a well developed story arc across the board.  I also liked that Maverick is represented as flawed, now aging, but still the incredible talent that adds value to the younger generation of pilots. Highly recommended, this is definitely a movie I will watch many times.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13266017100996472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454245160882551,0.0,0.1693028290860057,0.2186092257768782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186092257768782,0.3873556794765186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22075605184931757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362804685779315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2165434316190988,0.2165434316190988,0.14220376079319147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14884669589159494,0.0,0.17356868378687423,0.1628557333677315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277532732872018,0.14220376079319147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19641526254757297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16679535029708148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47754217830510187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16518532104019823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18173128374108868

6,grimsfield,"Aug 27, 2022","This movie just isn't as good as its hyped up to be. The first movie was better, and as unrealistic as that was, this is far more ridiculous. If you can get past the mountain of plot holes though, and the overly simple  rinse and repeat story, you'll probably enjoy this. All in all this felt akin to what home alone 2 did for home alone 1. Same basic story of the first movie, just reskinned.

It is not only about action, the beautiful pictures especially the wide angle perspectives from the jets and the support from Pentagon with military aircraft. Tom Cruise is perfect and his character is well written. Also I like the critics about the hierarchy in the military, that was great.
The only thing I didnt like? Of course this movie is very political correct (""strong women"" in the beginning -.- ) and US propaganda (of course USA is allowed to bomb enemy nuclear **** problem). And some of the scenes resembled too much to the first Top Gun. In the beginning I was even thinking if I downloaded the right movie, lol.

1,Broyax,"Aug 25, 2022","Voici la suite ou une espèce de suite du vieux film imbécile des années 80 au cours duquel Tom Bouse et ses talonnettes sévissaient déjà et excellaient en matière de prétention prétentieuse ! et d’ailleurs, lorsqu’il vient donner des leçons aux nouveaux **** cons de chez ‘Top Gun’, l’école d’élite, ceux-là sont carrément bluffés, estomaqués par autant de prétention… ils n’en reviennent pas !… et pourtant, Dieu sait qu’ils sont cons ! oui, le bon Dieu le sait, car tout cela nous dépasse.

Car en effet, encore un film à la gloire de Tom Bouse et en l’occurrence de son personnage de pilote de chasse sur le retour, qui sait tout et fait tout mieux que personne… pour une mission que l’on dirait tout droit sortie de Star Wars, le tout premier… sauf qu’on a remplacé les X-Wing par des F-18…!

Oui, ça en dit long sur le niveau de connerie, de beauferie, de ridicule du film entier avec en prime des passages psycho-dramatiques à la petite semaine, aussi grotesques que pathétiques. Et ridicules. Car so on peut résumer ce film en un mot, ce sera encore et toujours celui-ci, du début à la fin : ridicule ! ri-di-cule, putain de ridicule !

Du reste, tout n’y est pas entièrement mauvais et la réalisation est agréable, ni cut, ni move, juste normale. Et spectaculaire via des effets spéciaux évidemment au top. C’est Top Gun après tout malgré des longueurs regrettables soit dit en passant. Mais tout à fait fidèle au premier film, c’est un fait. Quant à dire lequel est le pire… je ne m’avancerais pas.

10,Voodoo123,"Aug 23, 2022",The fantastic cinematography and cast come together in a rare moment in which a sequel released so long after the original surpasses it so convincingly. Somehow it feels like anime levels of team bonding cheesiness mixed with military aircraft erotica and yet somehow it works for me. Very entertaining in an 80's cheesy way. Also as noted by several other reviews it's great to watch a film that isn't charged with the woke political garbage that has plagued all of Hollywood lately.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3294896834373735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34858319213633526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21303631741656093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094556261849564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385049649025641,0.0,0.0,0.2522348741327346,0.0,0.35222484955078365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222957246793087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393758220367982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582209531041687,0.0,0.3006990885980901,0.3385049649025641,0.0,0.0,0.0

9,Hossamhassan,"Aug 19, 2022","بمناسبة نزوله علي النت .. كلام عن top gun maverick من غير حرق .. توم كروز

الفيلم بيبتدي مع الكابتن الطيار ماڤريك .. المخضرم صاحب السجل العبقري و الأوسمة العجوز اللي برغم سنه الكبير لا زال طيار ومترقاش لإنه شايف إنه في مكانه الطبيعي الوحيد .. علي عكس رؤية العالم كله .. وتشاء الظروف وتنسبله مهمة خطيرة وحتمية وصعبة وهي السبيل الوحيد عشان يكمل في مكانه ومفيش مجال لرفضها .. ولكن طبيعة مكانه في المهمة جديدة عليه ومش حاببها  وأصبح مسئول عن ناس كتير معاه منهم ناس بتمثل خيوط الماضي اللي افتكرها بعدت عنه للأبد .. فيا تري ايه اللي هيحصل ؟

يحسب للفيلم إنه بالرغم إنه واخد كتير اوي من الجزء الأول ومتمسك بيه لآخر فصل ومشهد وباني عليه الدوافع والتحديات الرئيسية لبطلنا وكل مراحل الفيلم الحاسمة ولكنه محافظ علي نفسه بالكامل كفيلم مستقل .. اه الفيلم جزء تاني صريح للجزء الأول القديم جدآ عكس ما توقعت .. وباني علي أحداث الجزء ده ومستعين بيها في لحظات كفلاش باك كمان .. ولكن قدرته الدرامية علي تسكين اللي قلته ده كله حلوة اوي ومتحسسكش إنك مسقط حاجة لو مشفتش الجزء الأول شبهي كده .. الفيلم عاطفي في المقام الأول .. وراس ماله هو مدي الشحن والطاقة اللي بيصدرهالك سواء تعاطف أو حب أو خوف أو توتر أو فرحة .. والمشاعر ديه والمشاهد اللي الفيلم استهلكها عشان ده يتحقق لو مأثرتش فيك الفيلم ملهوش طعم .. مع الأخذ في الإعتبار إننا في فيلم أكشن بطله توم كروز .. يعني لازم كل اللي قلته ده يكون وسط مشاهد اكشن طويلة ومليان طبقات وجهد ذهني وبدني .. مليانة تفاصيل عن الطيران كتيرة ولكنها لازمة وفي وقتها وسهل فهمها ومفيش اي حاجة اتقالت مش فعالة بل بالعكس تحس إنك عايز نفهم أكتر .. تعليقي الوحيد بس هو إني حسيت إن الفيلم بيزرع بعض اللحظات الحلوة جدآ ولكن غرضها هو أنها تشحت مشاعري بالعافية عشان تقوي النقلة للفصل اللي هيبدأ بعدها .. اه ده مكانش حلو  وحسيته كزا مرة.. بس الفيلم بيكافئك كل مرة بيعمل فيها ده .. وكل الممثلين اللي في المهمة كويسين اوي بس في اللي تم استغلاله وفي اللي كان مجرد عدد زيادة يخدم الدراما وتحس الفيلم مش لاقيلهم حاجة يعملوها .. فهما دائماً معانا علي الشاشة بس بروحهم .. لا بيحركوا الأحداث ولا مهمين في أي وقت وفي النهاية اللي شايف إن توم كروز مش ممثل علي الأقل يشوف بعض مشاهده الفردية والثنائية في الفيلم ده .. تحديداً مشاهد تفاعله مع ذكرياته أو الناس اللي ابتعد عنها وقابلها تاني فجأة .. Maverick فيلم مهم وقوي ومميز في تاريخ توم كروز .. علي مستوي الأكشن وده كان متوقع وفعلاً في شغل مبهر .. ولكن المفاجأة هي المستوي التمثيلي والتحديات اللي قصاد توم كروز .. الشخصية مش معقدة وأبعادها مش عميقة اوي ولكنها لها أبعاد ومن لحم ودم وعنده ما يكفي لإثبات كل شئ في صفه .. وطبعاً فيلم مهم جداً في تاريخ أفلام الطيران الحربي والمعارك الجوية",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37594827078828474,0.46526143485667554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8013705103922941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I appreciate that they continue the tradition of not identifying the antagonist faction/OPFOR, and actually got to fly the jets thanks to Cruise's demands.

The only cons I have with it are that it's a bit of a nostalgia trip, they think F/A-16s can somehow compete against SU-35s. (You are horribly mistaken if you think this is the case), and that once again America thinks they are liberator and goes to unnamed country to bomb them because ""they aren't allowed their own nuclear deterrence""...

I felt like some of the Iceman stuff felt shoved in, and the last act might’ve played it too safe, but other than that the film is pure popcorn entertainment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20143305440203885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4854659461787809,0.0,0.22943736894736838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30296545749083903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44503814184746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14536626699746086,0.0,0.0,0.15202194679548006,0.1881374502600168,0.0,0.0,0.15479375762720465,0.17564163246035314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16202482437129,0.0,0.09446778559131014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18913887194837234,0.22943736894736838,0.18156256123760198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493733690746534,0.1571079587128906,0.20798725840849194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

8,MarkHReviews,"Jul 23, 2022","“Top Gun: Maverick” is an exhilarating film with no pretensions.  It just wants to be a first-rate diversion on a hot, humid summer afternoon.  By that measure, it exceeds expectations.  If you’re looking for an existential assessment of the human condition, go see “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”  If you want to examine the nature and texture of relationships, check out “Brian and Charles” or “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.”  “Maverick” is an unapologetic adrenaline rush that doesn’t have time to probe the darker corners of the human psyche.  So just sit back and savor Tom Cruise reprising his most iconic role.

This film works for three reasons: its visuals, its tone and what happens when there aren’t jets in the air.  Visually, “Maverick” is simply spectacular.  The dogfights and other aerial shots are all real, not CGI.  When you see the g-forces pressing on Tom Cruise’s face, that’s real.  This commitment to reality makes these action scenes even more riveting.

The tone of the film is equally skilled.  It’s self-referential without being self-absorbed.  There’s a bar where there are renditions of “Great Balls of Fire.”  There is beach football substituting for beach volleyball.  The admiral’s daughter (referenced in the original but never seen) shows up.  Most of all, there’s an appearance by Val Kilmer, who played fighter pilot “Iceman” in the original.  Here, he’s an admiral whose body is failing because of cancer.  He can speak only with great effort.  (In real life, Kilmer has battled throat cancer.  His brief speaking parts in “Maverick” are computer-generated.)

Finally, in “Maverick” the story keeps its footing even when it’s on the ground.  The original film was littered with excruciating dialogue filled with tortured clichés (“Your ego is writing checks your body can’t cash.”).  And because of Director Tony Scott’s advertising background, “Top Gun” featured way too many locker room scenes that just looked like product placement for Jockey briefs. By comparison, “Maverick” offers a cornucopia of interesting tidbits.  There’s a height-appropriate love interest for Cruise. (Jennifer Connelly is excellent.)  There’s also a surrogate father-son dynamic between Maverick and Goose’s son.  As a special bonus, Maverick appears incrementally more self-aware.  There’s even a female fighter pilot vying to become the gender-neutral alpha dog.

The plot is almost an afterthought.  After taking an experimental aircraft to Mach 10 in an opening scene, Maverick is assigned back to Top Gun School to train pilots for a suicide mission.  An unidentified rogue nation is engaging in uranium enrichment.  Maverick has to train pilots who will blow up the enrichment plant before this country can develop nuclear capability that will threaten civilization.  And so on.

A storyline that can be charitably described as “implausible” in no way detracts from the fun of this film.  In one of the three (count ‘em, three) climactic scenes, Maverick and his team attack the rogue nation, a country with plentiful evergreen trees and snow on the ground.  The uranium enrichment facility is three minutes from the coast.  Go to the biggest screen you can find to watch Tom Cruise bomb Norway.",0.0,0.08724765869751817,0.0,0.0,0.053946118247236594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09162618648281956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22636037121047728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067886211945239,0.0,0.0,0.08977021502529077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18947422882084783,0.2770915421231319,0.0,0.0,0.07718702902667646,0.0,0.10897368705913248,0.0,0.17037459283524836,0.07028336403785873,0.0,0.0,0.17348102681945943,0.06561524447872402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930851571396343,0.0,0.0,0.09365110571787398,0.665811866196285,0.0888972104732963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17348102681945943,0.0,0.08228075931238502,0.0,0.23961617639157473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21197240909481774,0.08571196273431923,0.06782715280488918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473067392863754,0.0,0.0,0.07103797063608346,0.16740626911429618,0.17607460673356928,0.0,0.0,0.06717243611025435,0.0,0.15644501404282696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3,TheGreenRoom,"Jul 19, 2022","To be fair, this movie does one thing extremely well. The jet flying sequences in this movie is top notch cinema, and it was extremely real and authentic without use of CGI. However, the greatness of the jet flying cannot overcome the ridiculousness of everything else in the movie. The dialogue was weird and cringe. Nothing about it seemed real and authentic unlike the jet flying. The love story was completely useless, and the plot is nonsense. It made me feel like the protagonists were the bad guys. Why would I root for someone who is going to other countries and dropping bombs on them unprovoked? This movie is nothing but a military propaganda film. Huge action and explosions with a weak plot and no substance.

We liked it, but I have never seen it again and it's not in my DVD collection. This one, Maverick, will definitely be in my DVD collection and after watching it this weekend in the theater, I may go watch it again in the theater. After the first 15 minutes, this movie is a rollercoaster ride with edge-of-your-seat thrills. In the 36 hours since I saw the movie, I continue to re-run it in my head. This one is so much better than the original, even with Tom Cruise in his late 50s when he made the movie - he's 60 now. I'm a few years older than him and I did not want to see an old  Tom Cruise in a Topgun movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Go see it.

10,Migs2209,"Jul 2, 2022","What a crazy movie! It's hard to catch your breath afterwards. The first film in the saga was not well evaluated by critics and a sequel seemed impossible... It wasn't what Tom Cruise thought, because no mission is impossible for him. Cruise is and always has been a great actor. Here, he reinforces that and does even more. He puts other actors inside a moving fighter jet. He enters one himself. And it's to fly! Beautiful until the last minute. I can only fill every second of this job with praise. Every character is fun. The only core that doesn't fit is that of Tom Cruise with Jennifer Connelly. It took just one step to wrap that core in the gripping narrative. Even though it's the weakest core, it's still fun and sometimes funny. It's a homage with a chance to compare to the first film.

6,BlackSteelApexx,"Jun 30, 2022","Definitely not the Citizen Kane of our time, as one might errantly infer from the rave reviews both from critics and audiences. It’s always plainly obvious when a film studio sells out to the Department of Defense and allows them veto power over the script for the sake of getting military cooperation in terms of consultation and provisioning equipment for the film itself. The plot seems to openly embrace U.S.’s love for military adventurism, with the focal point centering around the planning of an airstrike on a uranium enrichment center that “violates a NATO treaty”. Who’s the “rogue state” operating the plant? What jurisdiction or right does the U.S. have to just bomb it? Because they feel like it? This is the early 2000’s Iraqi Freedom brand of warhawking that even the Republicans party has tried to distance itself from as of late. But then again, the DoD controls the script… and so not only is this presented as completely okay, but never are these moral concerns even addressed. So perhaps it’s better to just turn one’s brain off and view the movie through an appropriate lens - 2 hours of DoD propaganda that’s good for some action shots of (undeniably) stunning and beautiful fighter aircraft. However, the movie’s odd pacing and inter-splicing of a needless romance only serve to detract from what this movie could do well - being a 2-hour theme park ride showing the F-18 and its Russian opponents duking it out. The actual airstrike and dogfights afterwards in fact are so hurried towards the tail end of the film and short-lived that it feels like a lot of waiting for high-stakes action beyond the pre-mission training exercises, that the wait hardly feels worth it. It’s a good movie if you’ve got 2 hours to kill, but this movie is extremely overrated and held back by poor acting, strange pacing, unwelcome side plots, and a criminally short dogfight sequence that, if it were much longer, would have GREATLY improved my opinion of the movie overall.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662317026796335,0.22772172732368157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14531088112857657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894726543074738,0.0,0.0,0.1841484446803883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1858570055860801,0.19995599346305235,0.3509043837586659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22923725201749387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441040577078463,0.2769803888943595,0.0,0.0,0.180907142537193,0.16739176771802516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18763005551630124,0.44691666134980274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1736651055248097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1858570055860801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14993562006332645,0.0,0.0,0.163994125174336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18249984580835363,0.0,0.0

5,Enerla,"Jun 20, 2022","The prequel is a legendary film. Some would say the prequel is a ""bromance"" film. Others point out how it is an important film to LGBT community. When Hollywood forces woke stuff on non-woke franchises, and the resulting story lacks integrity and characters, we often point out, they should create sequels to important ""LGBT"" stories, they should make films about real black characters, black history, etc. as it can be done with taste, and can still lead to a good story. Top Gun: Maverick is a missed opportunity in this department. While the action and the visuals are great, it is a story supposedly about relationship, and with that it is a missed opportunity. When ""only the core of the movie is bad"" that is an issue. As a modern day average action flick it would be excellent. As a continuation of Top Gun and a film that focuses on relationships?

10,mxs1438,"Jun 15, 2022","I saw this movie yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. I thought the original Top Gun was a great movie and it was a big surprise that 35+ years later, a sequel was made.

The sequel is based on the original Top Gun and takes the movie to new levels that are astonishing in many different ways. Obviously, the action scenes are completely amazing. Beyond that, this is a movie very much about relationships. Relationships about teams and relationships focusing on 1-1 dynamics. Painful history with a lot of hope and suspense to see how it unfolds.

In the end, the most significant aspect of this movie is Tom Cruise’s performance. He truly inhabits the character Maverick. Tom Cruise is one of the best actors of the 20th and 21st century and he proves it again and again in this movie.

9,theredsky,"Jun 14, 2022","Miles better than the original 1986 film and one of my favorite sequels of all time. God this film is just awesome. That’s the best way to describe it; awesome. The flying is awesome, the characters are awesome, the music is awesome, and the action is awesome. Tom Cruise’s dedication to making realistic action films with little to no visual effects has paid off incredibly well here. The flying scenes were filmed practically but they look amazing. Some of if not the best shot sequences of the year so far. I absolutely adore how they look and it’s amazing that the actors were able to act in those conditions. They all do a great job acting. Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell are all standouts here and their respective characters and journeys were really well done and even compelling at points. Val Kilmer did a great job as well under his own personal circumstances. The film handles Kilmer’s medical condition and character incredibly respectfully. It’s a great handling of his character. The action here is awesome. It’s incredibly well thought out and intense. You could know or predict the outcome of a scene and you could still feel your heart beating out of your chest just because of how well done the action is. It’s genuinely some of the best action in a blockbuster that I’ve seen in a long time. The final action scene itself is probably my favorite action scene of the year. It’s absolutely amazing and so much better than the final fight in the original film because it’s actually set up. The music here from the original Top Gun composer, Lady Gaga, and Hans Zimmer is great! The soundtrack itself isn’t near as good as the original 86 film but it’s still great here. I can’t wait to see how Cruise breaks the mold with action again in the future. This is a must see from me for everyone.

Maybe Cruise is working his Scientology crap on them.  Some of the WORST directing, acting and script I have ever seen, and I'm a huge movie buff.  LOVE the original, it was fun, this is almost an embarrassment. I've never seen a poor Jon Hamm performance until this, and Cruise is obviously in cruise mode lately as he hasn't made a decent film since MI3 and is now just riding the mediocrity train to the bank.  I have really gotten sick of these check the box films now too that ensure every race, creed, nationality and sex is equally represented for no artistic reason other than to appeal to everyone.  I have NO idea what the woman pilot was doing there, and she could've easily been replaced by a mannequin.  Connolly was boring and wooden.  The flight scenes ranged from meh to good, the music was bland, poorly used, and NOWHERE as emotion stirring as the original. The Val Kilmer treatment was a saving grace, but come on viewers and critics. There's no way you're keeping it real, or maybe you saw a different film. Maybe after a long theater absence you've lowered your standards and expectations and are just to eager for a great theater experience.  I get that, we all need that fun again.

10,robomartion,"Jun 9, 2022",It's really visceral edge of your seat no nonsense entertainment. Its biggest downfall is also its greatest and most stand-out unique quality and that is it never delves into the area of fiction like a James Bond film and is realism all the way. It feels almost like a real life account of what it would be like to be in an elite air force. The practical effects. It also sets the bar on how to do a reboot and I'm sure will make a lot of people think about signing up to the Navy. It is a true American film and gets the full 10 for not labelling any particular country as the enemy as well as for minimal drama with no unnecessary bickering manufactured division between the crew.

9,Mattyice,"Jun 6, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick ends up being one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original classic in almost every way. Adding depth and gravitas to the story, as well as gorgeous cinematography and stunt sequences, while retaining some of the cheesiness, humor, and charm that made the original an 80s icon. Tom Cruise is obviously the stand out of the cast with a fantastic and shockingly emotional performance, but the rest of the cast is great as well and the new pilots all have their own charm, although I did find Miles Teller's Rooster to be a bit miscast. The only cons I really have for the film are the fact that it's a bit too heavy on exposition for both Maverick and Penny's, as well as Maverick and Rooster's, relationships. It's depiction of the ""enemy"", which is clearly Russian/Chinese yet isn't stated as much or shown, is also odd, but studios want to make money and not get this movie banned from those countries, so it's understandable albeit clunky. Otherwise, Top Gun Maverick is one heck of a ride and a very worthy trip to the cinema.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37465707380076063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16653431073095243,0.19818398770405027,0.0,0.0,0.1236809769557031,0.0,0.18573338298972655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211199732627583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11908420193750527,0.0,0.24824246373290168,0.3072168536020972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17582873448304512,0.0,0.5291530918483882,0.0,0.07713003396189762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19068489077132827,0.0,0.0,0.25276865988005764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16056997311935386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18573338298972655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147269590843276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12195874982795075,0.12827380376664976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709598908430305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

9,RayneGokce,"Jun 5, 2022","The movie is excellent, you will definitely not regret it. The movie starts off well, with a little bit of classic comedy. On the other hand, they reflected the emotion well, the film director makes you feel the emotion while watching it. The shooting quality is good, the actors are well acted, the setting is nice and the subject is well chosen.

9,Halonut24,"Jun 4, 2022","It's a real treat in this day in age to have a sequel to a beloved classic film that actually fulfils the role of, well, a sequel. If you haven't seen it, or are debating seeing it, debate no longer. This is must-watch stuff right here. Go see it immediately.

To be entirely truthful, I fully expected this film to suffer from the same pitfalls all of these sequel/remakes do in today's age; to spit in the faces of the original, and re-make it in their own twisted image. Re-write characters to fit a new narrative. Break down their legacy into something unrecognizable. Like what Disney did to Star Wars over the past decade.
To my utter amazement, it never did. Not even a little bit. Every second of this film was totally respectful to it's 1986 predecessor. Almost all action seen is practical. Those F-18's were real F-18's, flown by real people, filmed with real cameras, and it's a sight to behold. The sound design beautifully translates the incredible power these machines possess. It's characters remain untarnished from revisionism. Maverick is still the same Maverick we knew all those years ago. The new characters are written realistically, with care and diligence. Our hero's struggles are approached with dignity and respect. Ulterior motives, personal politics, all absent from the film. With all of it wrapped in just the perfect amount of nostalgia tastefully sprinkled throughout the 2 hour runtime. Enough to harken back to it's roots, and tug on a few heart-strings, but it never dwells on it. Something this authentic and genuine needs to be openly praised and cherished. This is what we should expect sequels, and to that extent action films in general, to be. What a wonderful surprise.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16510472556468186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615681293167916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260091866827505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33922087078714097,0.0,0.13876353972435018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13475161225150328,0.0884911903900002,0.10040932771909108,0.13737306035353478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12311094284042211,0.0,0.18524997133122556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2670257140540908,0.12222616544492496,0.0,0.0884911903900002,0.12689951204053485,0.0,0.0,0.4889046617796998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13475161225150328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.207588308733569,0.2858712394021062,0.0,0.14172732251233452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279225818127133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130885536335393

9,HowToBen,"Jun 2, 2022","Top Gun: Maverick is a phenomenal example of modern-age cinematography. The 3-year delay for this movie is justified by the final product we are fortunate to see. It is far too common that Sequels for Standalone films are produced purely for 'nostalgia money' but Top Gun: Maverick is an anomaly of modern-age filmmaking. My respect for the cast and crew was further enhanced by the knowledge that they used practical effects and put the actors in actual Military-grade fighter aircraft. Too often are films quickly made and rushed with the use of CGI and it is incredibly refreshing to see a movie created with sheer passion and commitment to creating this sequel. I was not born to witness the original, but my Mother and her Friend's enjoyment in the cinema proved to me that this movie whilst bringing a new plot, could also pay homage to the feeling of the original.

The story is told in a manner that is neither boring nor underplayed, and the return of iconic actors in a realistic way further enhances the respect given to the original. Although there are elements of the plot that are bland, the feeling of the movie suits the narrative. The actors all deserve huge credit, not only for their performance but also for their dedication with flight-training to partake in their roles to the best of their capabilities.

This is a great movie in a time of over-saturation and CGI, I am so refreshed to see a movie that does not rely on the use of CGI and soleless storytelling, more like this, please.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4182993987669825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08903053549675705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903964251793684,0.4138305776175186,0.0,0.0,0.11471571966166082,0.13651732591980714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135163785424345,0.0,0.0,0.1409920484577263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14262703812529934,0.0,0.0,0.2730346518396143,0.0,0.0,0.08203012259536996,0.12687691531632428,0.17099967419753279,0.21162367261418288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09878396691844028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18225126544838346,0.0,0.31878214097617463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135163785424345,0.12024764788444667,0.0,0.26117625790249566,0.0,0.2477479089047463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09374791398874499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974522430385559,0.0,0.0,0.10694789902891273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11776424224688092,0.0,0.0,0.13794352587250622,0.0

10,mickrussom,"Jun 2, 2022","A rare sequel - this one is actually better than the original. If this was a stand alone movie it would be a seven/eight of ten. But as a sequel navigating the modern outrage mobs and other cantankerous spoilers and wreckers waiting in the wings to bring anything good down this thing is a solid ten. Tom Cruise doesn't look almost 60, he is in unreal shape for any age, but the work and dieting he must put in to look like this at 59 is nothing short of amazing. There is less cheese than was in the first movie, the music is great, and to see these people grunting and huffing while pulling real g-force maneuvers in real airplanes is so great. Tom Cruise had to take a huge amount of abuse to make this a reality - you can see the actors in planes sweating and suffering tunnel vision and black outs and redouts. One must have a healthy  respect for Tom Cruise for being one of the very very few in hollyweird that actually cares enough about his craft to put in the work. I hope this kicks off a new wave of serious remakes that can even outshine the original if done right and I hope this kicks off a new wave of movies that skip the idiotic computer generated trash and get back to practical effects like this movie. This is basically an 80's movie done right - take all the good music and good looking people, reduce the cheese and come up with an engaging multi-faceted multi-layered plot that develops emotion and take it to eleven on a scale of ten.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500291358629543,0.0,0.0,0.12189877963749722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152576110243859,0.14400562837845948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750128546435488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14689174666597649,0.0,0.1517065187471896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2639085814398946,0.1765277470251096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125818000825405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13032228396196946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22867166092122548,0.10727883114407658,0.2908396372745503,0.0,0.2826670004242619,0.0,0.0,0.18734929285834018,0.0,0.13328756195106997,0.0,0.2587713597700777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28528963341522895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017442802855325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14541981863727516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2711833684088357,0.28522530964876963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,beefalo16,"Jun 2, 2022","Overall a good movie and worth a watch for anyone who enjoyed the first one. Definitely some fan service, but movie also holds up on its own.

Main complaints holding it back from a higher rating:
1) Really needed a large dogfight scene, feels like so much wasted potential here. We didn't get to see all the pilots in action and a lot of the training seemed like it was irrelevant.
2) Zero attempt to flesh out the enemy/mission, was extremely contrived. I get that the focus was on Maverick but this still felt a bit lazy.
3) Some of the dialog/acting from the new pilots was pretty bad.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23735172972365898,0.16257472252480692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27053601395085547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27053601395085547,0.0,0.2653734579265703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27053601395085547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16365668343153156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3954827709989075,0.0,0.0,0.2583058616882475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1824112700826587,0.26790508372983507,0.21270800716461805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26293391192080195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22140868633330596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024342161541777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260579981908715,0.0,0.0
8,TVJerry,"Jun 2, 2022","More than 30 years later, Tom Cruise returns as the daring, renegade aviator from his original hit. His character is sent to teach a group of young pilots who are charged with an especially challenging mission. If you remember the original, there are lots of parallel scenes and relationships in this one, including a brief appearance by Val Kilmer. Basically, this film boils down to macho posturing peppered with flight footage and moments of romance. While the plot is predictable at every turn, the solid performances and tight editing help make it appealing. However, it's the spectacular aerial scenes that makes the movie memorable.

10,rattley,"Jun 2, 2022","Outstanding. And I don’t write that lightly. This film really delivers. I wanted to watch it again immediately. Solid but simple story line.
Great cast. Amazing flight sequences. Action.  Humour. Sadness. Love. Just a great blockbuster movie . To be honest, I’ve missed this sort of cinematic experience. This all being lead by the unbelievable , incredible Tom Cruise. Who truly puts himself on the line for the film goers. A true artist. One of the last real classic film stars. This film has all that you need. Will it win Oscars? Probably not. But will you get your money worth? Absolutely. In my humble opinion, This is such a better movie than the first, even though I still love that movie. I was gripped within the first opening minutes. My heart did not stop beating at high rates in anticipation of every moment. I was not disappointed. It’s been a long long time since I’ve experienced that rush and enjoyment watching a film.  I recommend anyone to go see this film. You will not leave disappointed. ( I hope).

8,digitalkoimoi,"Jun 2, 2022","What’s Good: It’s not just action and visually shocking stunts that overpower the narrative, but an emotional story and a touching conflict that manages to grab your attention.

What’s Bad: The women in this universe are strong but don’t get enough to do. They support the men and that cannot be the only thing they get to do.

Loo Break: Please no, Tom Cruise is returning after decades and you cannot really miss even a single scene. Plus it’s in theatres, there will be intermission in India at least.

Watch or Not?: Miles Teller in an interview told me there is almost no green screen involved, if you won’t acknowledge this effort, who will?

Sly had already tried it with the trilogy ""The Expendables"", an economic but not critical success: a dozen years ago the hangover of the planetary reviewers was aimed at crossmedialization (or globalization) and panned as ""nostalgia operation"" everything what was distant from the new trend. Instead Bruckheimer returns to produce not silly TV series but a blockbuster, calling back in their roles as film stars actors sold off to the fictions of the streaming platforms: Val Kilmer, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris. Not a masterpiece but not even the caricature of a blockbuster: fortunately it is not Bergman who plays chess with death, but it is the identical concept adapted for the masses (""Time is your worst enemy""). And it is also metacinematographic: the military mission to be accomplished is feasible only by downgrading the paraphernalia and relying on the additional capabilities of the human factor so as to circumvent the digital supertechnology set up to fight something that on paper should no longer exist. This reminds the historic lose wars because of an arsenal suitable for pitched battles and not for guerrilla warfare. Havin' learned the lesson, passed the period of famine, victory is guaranteed.

9,MovieWarfare,"May 29, 2022","Firstly, the flying sequences are breathtaking and this is all because they did it practically. This is especially noticeable in the final act which is one of the best I've seen in recent memory. Additionally, the music score by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga, Hans Zimmer, & Lorne Balfe is very good. I love how they incorporated those 80s tracks into the film while giving more modern and fitting music as well. Furthermore, their music score during the intense action scenes are well done and helps to make the scenes tenser.

Tom Cruise is still great as Maverick even after almost 30 years. He still embodies the character perfectly and does feel like a natural evolution of his character from the first film. I genuinely believe that this is what Maverick would be like in 30 years. Miles Teller is also great as Rooster, Goose's son, and he has great synergy with Tom Cruise in their scenes together. Jennifer Connelly plays the new love interest for Maverick, Penny, and she is also great in her role thanks to her great chemistry with Tom. Glen Powell plays the rival to Miles and he is very good at being this overly cocky, hateable guy. Likewise, Jon Hamm plays the commander that is antagonistic to Maverick and he also does a good job at being hateable as well. Val Kilmer is one of the few actors from the original to return and I was interested to see how they would handle his throat cancer situation in real life. Thankfully, this film handles it respectfully and probably results in one of the most emotional scenes in the film. The rest of the supporting cast, including those who play the recruits, all do a good job as well.

Moreover, the story itself is also surprisingly enjoyable. The first Top Gun was a cheesy action flick but this one is a very down to earth, character-driven story. Maverick is a lot wiser now thanks to the character arc he got from the first film when he was a student. However, now he has to be the teacher and this is a great antithesis to the story in the first film. The conflict between Maverick and Rooster is the heart and soul of this film. This family dynamic they have is the most engaging aspect of the story as Maverick now struggles with the possibility of letting the son of his once best friend die. Nevertheless, I do have some minor nitpicks with the film. I do find the dynamic of the recruits never does quite match the dynamic of the recruits from the first film. I never felt as strong of an attachment to the recruits and this is probably due to the film focusing on the teacher Maverick. There is also a romantic subplot with Maverick and Penny that just feels very superfluous. It never felt like the romance part was even connected to anything in the main plot. Heck, you could take this romance subplot and Penny out of the film and the main story is still the same. It just felt like the romance plot just took away screen time from the interesting stuff. I am also a little annoyed that there is no dialogue or line to explain why Maverick isn't with Charlie from the first film anymore. Especially, considering how relevant that character was in the first film.

Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is better than the first movie in almost every aspect. It has more amazing action sequences and a more interesting character-driven story. In a world where CGI seems to always be the go-to solution, we then get a rare movie like this where the majority is practical and it is all the better for it.

This movie relentlessly builds the character up into an infallible, extremely boring superhero, who gets second chances for anything and everything. The new generation of pilots that should surpass and replace a man past his physical prime isn't even allowed to come close to him. Also, nepotism is OK when it benefits Maverick, for some reason.

The original movie, so often dismissed as ""dumb Reaganite bombast"", had characters who were at least human. Interesting at times. Definitely not fit for real military service, but good for a story. Top Gun Maverick is much sillier and less believable than its forebear.",26.551836094703507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508672713723508,0.22225700222743094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533308837701806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15324869928828733,0.0,0.0,0.32053056174425226,0.19833913421100674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512431682401539,0.0,0.2987707994200463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24621224844448092,0.0,0.0,0.32637478425073513,0.23401652006951282,0.0,0.0,0.22539836000098556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18266948373423508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

9,Rebecca31,"May 29, 2022","Alright folks, strap yourselves in for one of the most anticipated movies of the year, the Navy’s top aviators are finally back. After over thirty years, Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) has been called back into service. Join Cruise and all the other top pilots in their most dangerous mission yet, only this time without the cheesy 80s soundtrack. Maverick finds himself in the unlikely position as a teacher to the best of the best Top Gun graduates for a confidential and highly dangerous mission in “insert generic country here.” Not only is Maverick faced with the difficult task of training these pilots for a mission “the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen” but one of the recruits is Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller) aka “Rooster” aka the son of “Goose”.

Well I know the original Top Gun has a massive fanbase, who I can only imagine love it so much due to nostalgia because if like me you recently watched it, I think we all realise it has not aged well at all. Top Gun: Maverick has taken the franchise to a whole new level, very much like the Mission Impossible movies, it’s kicked it into a new gear and is all about the action. The flight sequences are an exhilarating thrill ride you won’t want to miss. Adrenaline fuelled, gripping and so well filmed that you will feel like you’re sitting in the jets themselves. Visually epic, and exceeds expectations. It’s not necessary to see the original Top Gun beforehand but it does help. And although Top Gun: Maverick isn’t as cheesy as the first one, it does have enough cringey dialogue to remind you that you are in fact watching a Top Gun movie.

There’s also a surprising emotional element throughout that I definitely wasn’t expecting, and the decision to bring back Val Kilmer as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky was handled perfectly. Miles Teller was absolutely perfect casting for Lt. Nick Bradshaw’s son. It’s been a while since I’ve seen Teller in anything as good as Whiplash and he’s here now reminding us all of how good an actor he really is. Top Gun: Maverick has improved on the original in every way and caters towards both new and old fans of Top Gun.

I was “lucky” enough to be sitting right next to three of Tom Cruise’s biggest fans. They might have been enjoying it more than everyone else in the cinema combined judging by their whooping, clapping and the fact that they were practically wetting themselves with anticipation any time Cruise was onscreen or there was any sort of reference made to the original Top Gun. These ultra-fanboys loved every minute of it so Top Gun fans I can promise you’ll absolutely adore this sequel.

Look many of you know that I’m not the biggest Tom Cruise fan at all but when he’s delivering on the action it’s honestly a terrific experience to see on the big screen in a cinema. He may not be Hollywood’s greatest actor but he’s got one setting that he does better than anyone, and that setting is action man. Despite being nearly sixty he does not shy away from the stunts and in a time where cinemas are struggling I can tell you that Top Gun: Maverick is made for the big screen so be sure you see it on the biggest screen possible and enjoy.

7,Stream2BigScree,"May 28, 2022","Hey, Streamers, let's fly off into the Danger Zone. Yes, it's Top Gun: Maverick time. The sequel you have been waiting almost 40 years for, which was supposed to come out 2 years ago, is finally here. Now, I have never seen the original film, but I was keen to see what all the hype around this sequel was about. Tom Cruise has made good choices over the years and he's always going full tilt in these action roles, so I didn't expect for this to disappoint. Here's how it goes.

Even though Top Gun: Maverick is a present-day sequel to the original Top Gun (1986), the movie really leans into that old-fashioned, 1980's action film vibe. Also, there is a big spoiler from the original film that is central to the story of this sequel - Maverick's wingman, Goose, died. Here, Goose's son, Rooster (Miles Teller), is one of the elite Navy aviators, who Maverick (Tom Cruise) is tasked with training for what's considered an important but impossible mission. There is tension between Maverick and Rooster because of their fraught history. There is tension between Maverick and his superiors because he is notorious for going rogue. Nevertheless, Maverick is the best and the mission requires the best. High-flying hijnks ensue.

Top Gun: Maverick is the kind of movie that begs to be seen on a big screen. In my opinion, the story is not really great or innovative, so the actions sequences, stunts and camera work have to justify the price of admission. Luckily, they very much do. The aerial shots and all of the fighter jets flying have to be seen on a big screen to truly be appreciated. The rumble of the jets and the perceived danger add to the tension that builds up through the movie and explodes in the final sequences. While there is an attempt to build an emotional core to the film by focusing on Maverick and Rooster's relationship and also a slight love interest on the side, those relationships barely register and seem almost superfluous. Honestly, they could've cut the love story and the film would have been the same but 10-15 minutes shorter - that would have given them the ability to cultivate the Maverick and Rooster relationship, which would have been more impactful.

Some of this movie is so retro as to be kind of corny. Glen Powell plays Hangman. He's one of the **** aviators in the Top Gun program. Powell plays it like the quintessential 1980's movie villain, which was groan-inducing at times, but some may love it. Tom Cruise is at his Tom-Cruise-iest, which isn't a bad thing. Movies need stars and Tom Cruise is still a movie star. He still has the charm to pull off Maverick's character. As the movie leans into the nostalgia, Tom Cruise makes it worthy of being on a big screen. This movie desperately needs that.

Nevertheless, what was presented was certainly entertaining. There will be times when the flying will have you on the edge of your seat. That's why a movie like this is made. In that way, it is quite successful.

Ultimately, Top Gun: Maverick is tailor-made to be seen in a movie theater. The feats of stunts and action are worthy of the big screen. There are times when you may be on the edge of your seat. Although the story is a bit lacking, the rest of the movie makes up for it and the 2-hour runtime flies by in a *wink*. Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this spectacle on a big screen.",0.0,0.056303491993621474,0.0,0.0,0.10443907202199716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0579313721238678,0.07632535268562016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3511064936447532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05736799649250528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21911555344381112,0.0,0.0,0.056825885465047174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06113665905005924,0.17881535913208146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035044710277103215,0.03516197000839295,0.0,0.21989551735418192,0.18142372567771506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468691188552072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535403853646618,0.0,0.0,0.1208716511066699,0.4687288030494369,0.11473599298501055,0.2505158775444978,0.04273702131016171,0.0,0.059767601008899066,0.0,0.05154379945704677,0.059767601008899066,0.11195243231039861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948229317946666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27656231007300375,0.1750834629564151,0.1607390668562873,0.10968292243616712,0.0,0.056303491993621474,0.0,0.0,0.16709046572439146,0.05736799649250528,0.0,0.04584290135301494,0.21606442335459333,0.22725229211876988,0.0501412973092438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050479294958162974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14307117567231162

8,Dee-Jay_Deli,"May 28, 2022","This is good. Mostly thanks to the unique air-combat action that is thrilling to watch. Not to say the human drama doesn't do its job, but it clearly isn't the priority. The movie does build on the original's characters and events a little more than I expected. It's easy to gripe about too many side-characters and how a little more focus on the core characters and relationships would have given it more emotional punch, but that's only a minor issue. Overall, Top Gun Maverick is an absolutely thrilling experience, especially on a large screen and the movie (literally) takes off.",0.0,0.0,0.22353330828849752,0.0,0.13298307895882208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.582447812144439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2150750167485639,0.22353330828849752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2012853227623052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13386810272177124,0.0,0.0,0.13999733232426229,0.1732561758475918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4425867877331545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14920900343950952,0.0,0.173991167093211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425498987814659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21914134220760104,0.0,0.21128935831444123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16558739841423106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

9,Compi24,"May 27, 2022","Honestly, the hype this had coming out of Cannes had me a bit worried. If even that film festival's occasionally-fussy audience members managed to bestow this with near-universal acclaim, then that's a lot of damn pressure on me to like this thing too. Christ alive did I nothing to worry about. Not only is ""Top Gun: Maverick"" at least a worthy companion piece to the seminal 80's classic, it's a disarmingly superior film and quite possibly one of the best sequels to a movie that's about as much of a cultural fixture as movies can get. Joseph Kosinski, Tom Cruise and the screenwriting and stunt teams needs to take a victory lap on this one. Potent emotionality, eminent likability on the part of Cruise and ripping soundtrack aside, the thing I loved the most about this one is how much the stakes and circumstances are ramped up this time around. I remember the set pieces in the original Tony Scott film being engaging and entertaining, but never quite as intense and menacing as they're presented here. There's almost a point in the film where you as an audience member are dreading the moment where this final mission has to take place. The action also scales in such a satisfying way throughout the course of the film, with the finale honestly constituting one of the best action sequences I've seen in a movie in a very, very long time. Doubtful that any summer movie's going to top this in the coming months. Completely floored with how much I absolutely loved nearly every minute of this.",0.0,0.0,0.17038275813406567,0.0,0.20272615255102247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22223213198595787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21266204426058022,0.0,0.15967872297845395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5206463788701758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067095181270872,0.13206025236549682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12328900108162867,0.0,0.17216275111264398,0.16105010886131038,0.0,0.35193502259648113,0.0,0.0,0.11373088753130181,0.16703509017252588,0.19893072200706904,0.12443492268691353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865514903385812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12744510794648178,0.0,0.15967872297845395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266956269329414,0.10485038884826155,0.11027956766490589,0.14599352652155367,0.16867543853989367,0.0,0.0,0.14697765480242697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

8,ty92,"May 27, 2022",This movie was solid overall with a good opening and a great ending with a bunch of filler in the middle that hurt the pacing of the movie. All the action scenes are incredible. The romance between Maverick and the bartender didn't work for me at all and all those scenes were bad. Maverick trains all these top gun fighters for a mission that's like something from Ace Combat 7. Ice man was in this too and there's some emotional scenes with him. Movie could have been amazing but it was just missing something in the middle that could have made it a little more interesting or entertaining. Honestly the middle of this movie dragged. If you like the romance stuff maybe you disagree but it didn't work for me. Also Goose's son is in this movie as a fighter pilot and there's a storyline involving him in Maverick that is interesting and it really works well. Some of this movie is incredible and better than the original. But I think in the original the romance worked more. In this one it didn't at all maybe because Tom Cruise is older and the actress playing the bartender is not that good looking and old,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08981432179519346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252833678091728,0.0,0.14945748168485112,0.0,0.0,0.11462233658077355,0.14800402563816853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421624707269222,0.0,0.0,0.4398162907979139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15772681994671112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18082410108263708,0.09071456959963005,0.0,0.09455161930589208,0.0,0.0,0.2932108605319426,0.09627557566925686,0.21848425331638355,0.14945748168485112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023190368559415,0.14800402563816853,0.35253128728512356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15419477919554975,0.19255115133851372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223171148242697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35291062231562115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427009403612116,0.0,0.09290430904812662,0.0977149169266441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

5,azzamann79,"May 27, 2022",I'm not sure what movie others were watching but this is not even close to bettering the original. It lacks the soul of the original. From the  one liners that people still remember today the cast of over the top egotistical characters who are larger than life. The great soundtrack that strikes up at the right time. This movie has none of it. It try's to ride on the coat tails of nostalgia and falls flat. It won't take your breath away.

8,JLuis_001,"May 27, 2022","Many times the entertainment that doesn't seek to be complicated tends to be very relaxed and ends up being rather poor and, of course, completely forgettable.
Top Gun: Maverick falls into the category of pure entertainment, but it's one that makes the case of how to do it the right way. The story may seem simple yes, I'll give you that, but its strength is the action sequences and the film doesn't lie about it and gives it to you in abundance. Everything that happens with jets in this film is spectacular, especially that beautiful opening sequence with Maverick piloting that hypersonic plane. Does it rely on nostalgia? Of course, especially with that little Val Kilmer appearance, but it never feels like a gratuitous resource within the story. After all the movie makes it clear that it's a sequel, but it's not 100% vital for you to have seen the original.
And even if you can question how necessary this sequel was after 36 years, this story proves its functionality in the blockbuster branch that should continue to invest in films like this one. Yes, it's a sequel and stars an ultra-famous name, but there's life for blockbusters outside of superheroes.
Of course, that remains to be seen at the box office, after all, even with inflation, the original film cost just over $30 million, Top Gun: Maverick, not counting marketing, cost over $150 million.

It sounds repetitive and perhaps for people who prefer streaming they won't even flinch, but as Cruise said it and as he fought for it, films like these are the ones that remind us why the theatrical experience will never be matched. Go see it, and have a good time.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334018496754496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603758767420135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08742480376226919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13478701063368667,0.28017560437052536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12614504162185097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25684361867501404,0.0,0.28017560437052536,0.0,0.08389482729258614,0.0,0.0,0.1754720023361719,0.21715848143926433,0.0,0.0,0.0893356886046445,0.30410269297704273,0.13868405304893752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2893591133720741,0.2805268018194017,0.0,0.05451992900825097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339260673751176,0.0,0.178671377209289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603758767420135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20956938679720347,0.2885993951679993,0.13128700111897432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30000303155618635,0.0,0.0,0.10974501604354996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120844250070275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11416779193081303

The first and third acts keep in glued to the screen in anticipation to what will happen next. The nostalgia music sounds just as good 30 years later. All actors from Tom Cruise to the younger crew do an exceptional job in their acting. The real jet fighter scenes really encapsulate the jaw dropping moments during several parts in the film. The revamped volleyball scene does not disappoint either.

8,43in2014,"May 27, 2022","The short review: This has the best jet fighter action scenes in a film, EVER. The human drama part, however, falls a bit short. Related media: I have seen the original Top Gun film on TV numerous times. That film likely had the best jet fighter action scenes in a film back then too, and the human drama part also fell a bit short back then too.


Positives:


1) All the jet fighter scenes are genuinely, top of the class! 2) The sound effects and the special effects are really top notch!


3) The excuse used to feature the F-14 fighter in the film in a major way, when no F-14 is allowed to fly anymore, in the military or by the public, is CLEVER.


Negatives: 1) (This is hinted at in the trailer, so it’s not spoiler.) It has been some 35 years since the events in the original film. Surely the grief over the death of Goose should be over by now? This part is rather unrealistic. I know there’s more to it, but still…


2) The past relationship between Maverick and new flame was hinted at, but not covered much in this film. This coincided with a slow part of the film, thus making this part feel poor.


3) The original film had two great original songs. The songs in this film are not great.



4) (This is hinted at in the trailer, so it’s not a spoiler.) The top enemy fighter plane is obviously the Russian Su-57 (Felon), yet the film makes all attempts to call it the ‘fifth generation fighter’ rather than its real name, all the time, such that the film distributor can sell the film to the Russian market. That’s silly! Considering the banning of such sales following the Russo-Ukrainian war, that’s all for nought! Pilots would not use so many words to describe the fighter. As with the original Top Gun film, where the enemy fighter was given the fictitious name, Mig-28, here the fighter should also had been given a fictitious name, like ‘Firefox’.


Children: Excellent.


Teens: Excellent.


Young adults: Excellent.


Medium-age adults: Excellent


Older adults: Good.                    My rating: 4/5 (no half scores). Definitely watch it in the cinema.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032122546736588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804960265225291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056725894536175124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06683014381363439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394386069292168,0.26732057525453756,0.0,0.0,0.06555484461590318,0.6347501207252647,0.5775923483346678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04042788806586948,0.08112631986023498,0.0,0.08455780526730573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048847785689769246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697193034646084,0.04506080811505664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495220688193003,0.0,0.0,0.21524886192328477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0594613834288305,0.05469428684615212,0.06222958844533782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15780452993610647,0.0,0.05049445826929406,0.0,0.0,0.06894843371360432,0.12990441376386005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052884776899561815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050007049267908624,0.0,0.05823336161366353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0550160583418266
