Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."

But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie?

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films.

Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.

Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."

David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.

It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."

Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!
Brochaco J,5.0,"Apr 29, 2025",Great mvoew i was very pleased with ts
Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Frans B,5.0,"Mar 22, 2025","How times have changed... Makes me wonder how the original got rated at half this score, but anywhooooo ... This is a whole new level and probably will never be attempted again, or copied in any way, like Tom Cruise said. True that. Undoubtedly the best of the 2, naturally, but as is comparing apples to oranges. This one is in a whole new universe. Worth watching at least 5 times, or more ..."

Especialmente as qualidades visuais e sonoras do filme. Todo aspecto audiovisual é simplesmente perfeito e quem assisitiu no cinema (em um bom cinema de preferencia) pode sentir na pele o que é dirigir um caça.

Fenomenal!!

----

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing

Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."

Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

STEPHEN P,2.5,"Feb 17, 2025","Of course way over hyped and way over done. Relying on so much ""action"" and special effects just is a substitute for better writing and character development - this whole thing is Alpha male, never loses, no matter what even crazy odds against it.

Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."

David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."

Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."
Jack G,5.0,"Jun 20, 2025",Absolute CINEMA and the definition of a perfect Blockbuster
Sergio A,5.0,"Jun 19, 2025","I went in without having seen the first film, and wow, what a surprise. It delivers action, romance, friendship, fatherhood, and personal growth. One of the best surprises a blockbuster has ever delivered."

Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Brayden G,5.0,"May 16, 2025",Way better than the first one I saw this in the theaters when it came out so intense in the Theaters it’s so good on the biggest screen possible
Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rated PG-13 for Some Strong Language and Sequences of Intense Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $718,500,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there!

Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic.

Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro! O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."

Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."

Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."

Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Frans B,5.0,"Mar 22, 2025","How times have changed... Makes me wonder how the original got rated at half this score, but anywhooooo ... This is a whole new level and probably will never be attempted again, or copied in any way, like Tom Cruise said. True that. Undoubtedly the best of the 2, naturally, but as is comparing apples to oranges. This one is in a whole new universe. Worth watching at least 5 times, or more ..."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro!

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing

Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.

Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."
andre b,5.0,"Mar 1, 2025","Sehr unterhaltsamer Film, tolle Bilder, toller Cast und super Soundtrack. Noch ne ordentliche Nummer besser als Teil 1."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

STEPHEN P,2.5,"Feb 17, 2025","Of course way over hyped and way over done. Relying on so much ""action"" and special effects just is a substitute for better writing and character development - this whole thing is Alpha male, never loses, no matter what even crazy odds against it. Surprise - very predictable."

And very good for all that.
Helps if you’ve seen the original - and everyone has."
Tbone P,5.0,"Jan 15, 2025",Great movie! They came up with a really good story for the sequel
Tom,5.0,"Jan 13, 2025",Great Movie!  Would love to watch the first one and second one back to back in theatre's.
Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"
prawnda s,2.5,"Jan 9, 2025","i cannot deny that this is a technically impressive film. at the same time, i dont know how they managed to make fighter jet combat so boring."
,5.0,"Jan 9, 2025","Amazing film and a worthy successor to the original. You don't see a film like this these days and it's such a refreshing breath of fresh air. Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."
Desmond N,5.0,"Jan 8, 2025",10 out of 10 amazing women specially viola Davis
W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro! O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."
,4.0,"Jan 5, 2025","I really enjoyed this movie, one of my bigger surprises of the year. A fun and likeable action movie that knows exactly what it is."
ALL- C,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Wow, wow, wow. I wish the story was a little more intricate - but this provides some of the best acting and action of the past decade. Brilliant."
,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Movie of the Year 2022

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."
T J,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Pure awesomeness, thank you Tom Cruise"
Nolan S,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Probably best movie I have ever seen, absolute Cinema"
Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."
Chloe  _,4.5,"Dec 23, 2024",I mean wow. Did not think it could be better than the original but the plot and development are just stunning. Really makes you feel something.
,3.0,"Dec 23, 2024","This is why you buy 100"" TV.
Visually beatiful. So turn off your brain and enjoy the flight!"
T Scott B,1.0,"Dec 23, 2024","What a piece of crap. Nothing believable in this movie, complete horseshit."
Caleb S,5.0,"Dec 21, 2024","A American made masterpiece. Filled with an amazing story and gripping stunts, top gun maverick will go down as one of the best movies in the last decade."
Stella B,3.5,"Dec 19, 2024",This was every fan boy's dream!!!
Abubakar B. S,5.0,"Dec 16, 2024",This is the best movie of 2022. The action is out of this world. Tom Cruise did a good job. Kudos. I have watched it more than 5 times.
Kauã M,5.0,"Dec 15, 2024","Simply flawless, a film that promised nothing and delivered everything and more, every aspect raised to the highest possible quality, I waited a long time to see this film and it was worth every second of the incredible experience."
Brenda,4.5,"Dec 15, 2024",Exceptional film. Great performances. Action & storytelling have you on the edge of your seat. The best soundtrack. Highly recommend this movie
Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"
jake,5.0,"Nov 27, 2024",Great movie! Enjoyed it!
Colin E,5.0,"Nov 27, 2024",Proof that good movies are still capable of being made.
Stephen H,4.5,"Nov 25, 2024",Holy crap! So good! Better than the original! So entertaining in all aspects.
Cavanagh W,4.5,"Nov 20, 2024",This movie reminds me why I love America.
Opelman,5.0,"Nov 19, 2024",Another great Tom Cruise action series.
,4.5,"Nov 6, 2024","I honestly went into this film a little skeptical. Shockingly, Top Gun: Maverick just might be better than the original. Seriously, it's just that good."
Morghen V,5.0,"Nov 4, 2024",This movie is incredible. If you haven’t seen it you’re missing out
Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.
max e,5.0,"Oct 20, 2024",Best movie of 2022 with great action
Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"
Garrett B,5.0,"Oct 15, 2024",There has not yet been a legacy sequel more awesome than this. 🇺🇸 😎✈️🪖
Melissa,5.0,"Oct 13, 2024",Súper intense!!! One of my favorite (top 10) movies ever!
Daniel M,5.0,"Oct 10, 2024","The perfect epic movie! Cruise was fantastic, the story was good with a mission that made me care about all the characters and it had many emotional moments. The directing was perfect, a very well made movie!"
Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."
Samjhana K,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024",Phenomenal! Worth the wait.
Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."
Mundo C,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","BEST movie ever, absolutely all were perfect"
Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."
,4.0,"Sep 17, 2024",I would say I don't think I enjoyed it to the level everyone else did. But I sure as heck had a great time. I think it's a fun movie and see why everyone likes it so much.
Ted P,5.0,"Sep 11, 2024",in 4D It was like being in the plane ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

9/10"
Suicide N,0.5,"Sep 6, 2024",I have never checked a movie 6 times to see how much longer the torture world continue.  Not memorable at all and quite boring.
Vanessa S,5.0,"Sep 6, 2024",Loved it all the way! Even better than Top Gun.  Awesome!
Jason Loves W,4.0,"Sep 5, 2024","One of the best movie ever made. I feel like this sequel is came out right on time and far better than original movie, which is good. Tom Cruise is terrific in this movie. The final dogfight scene is thrilling and look so realistic. All cast are great."
Theo C,3.0,"Sep 4, 2024",I tried to watch it but i fell asleep
,4.5,"Sep 1, 2024",I was prepared to not like this movie before i saw it. It's  a great sequel and a solid movie by itself. I highly recommend.
Takushi Y,3.0,"Aug 31, 2024","prime, 6.8.30
ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"
PH N,5.0,"Aug 30, 2024","Wonderful writing, good acting, breathtaking visual effects. It's an awesome takeover for the franchise. It will make you want to watch more of it."
Nipun H,5.0,"Aug 28, 2024","Literally, this is the perfect sequel that ups the ante while introducing new interesting characters while respecting the iconic original cast & movie"
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro! O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"

Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."

This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."

O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."

Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."

Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rated PG-13 for Some Strong Language and Sequences of Intense Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $718,500,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

STEPHEN P,2.5,"Feb 17, 2025","Of course way over hyped and way over done. Relying on so much ""action"" and special effects just is a substitute for better writing and character development - this whole thing is Alpha male, never loses, no matter what even crazy odds against it. Surprise - very predictable."

Tom,5.0,"Jan 13, 2025",Great Movie!  Would love to watch the first one and second one back to back in theatre's.
Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"
prawnda s,2.5,"Jan 9, 2025","i cannot deny that this is a technically impressive film. at the same time, i dont know how they managed to make fighter jet combat so boring."
,5.0,"Jan 9, 2025","Amazing film and a worthy successor to the original. You don't see a film like this these days and it's such a refreshing breath of fresh air. Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."
Desmond N,5.0,"Jan 8, 2025",10 out of 10 amazing women specially viola Davis
W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro! O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."
,4.0,"Jan 5, 2025","I really enjoyed this movie, one of my bigger surprises of the year. A fun and likeable action movie that knows exactly what it is."
ALL- C,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Wow, wow, wow. I wish the story was a little more intricate - but this provides some of the best acting and action of the past decade. Brilliant."
,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Movie of the Year 2022

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."
T J,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Pure awesomeness, thank you Tom Cruise"
Nolan S,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Probably best movie I have ever seen, absolute Cinema"
Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."
Chloe  _,4.5,"Dec 23, 2024",I mean wow. Did not think it could be better than the original but the plot and development are just stunning. Really makes you feel something.

Visually beatiful. So turn off your brain and enjoy the flight!"
T Scott B,1.0,"Dec 23, 2024","What a piece of crap. Nothing believable in this movie, complete horseshit."
Caleb S,5.0,"Dec 21, 2024","A American made masterpiece. Filled with an amazing story and gripping stunts, top gun maverick will go down as one of the best movies in the last decade."
Stella B,3.5,"Dec 19, 2024",This was every fan boy's dream!!!
Abubakar B. S,5.0,"Dec 16, 2024",This is the best movie of 2022. The action is out of this world. Tom Cruise did a good job. Kudos. I have watched it more than 5 times.
Kauã M,5.0,"Dec 15, 2024","Simply flawless, a film that promised nothing and delivered everything and more, every aspect raised to the highest possible quality, I waited a long time to see this film and it was worth every second of the incredible experience."
Brenda,4.5,"Dec 15, 2024",Exceptional film. Great performances. Action & storytelling have you on the edge of your seat. The best soundtrack. Highly recommend this movie
Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"
jake,5.0,"Nov 27, 2024",Great movie! Enjoyed it!
Colin E,5.0,"Nov 27, 2024",Proof that good movies are still capable of being made.
Stephen H,4.5,"Nov 25, 2024",Holy crap! So good! Better than the original! So entertaining in all aspects.
Cavanagh W,4.5,"Nov 20, 2024",This movie reminds me why I love America.
Opelman,5.0,"Nov 19, 2024",Another great Tom Cruise action series.
,4.5,"Nov 6, 2024","I honestly went into this film a little skeptical. Shockingly, Top Gun: Maverick just might be better than the original. Seriously, it's just that good."
Morghen V,5.0,"Nov 4, 2024",This movie is incredible. If you haven’t seen it you’re missing out
Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.
max e,5.0,"Oct 20, 2024",Best movie of 2022 with great action
Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"
Garrett B,5.0,"Oct 15, 2024",There has not yet been a legacy sequel more awesome than this. 🇺🇸 😎✈️🪖
Melissa,5.0,"Oct 13, 2024",Súper intense!!! One of my favorite (top 10) movies ever!
Daniel M,5.0,"Oct 10, 2024","The perfect epic movie! Cruise was fantastic, the story was good with a mission that made me care about all the characters and it had many emotional moments. The directing was perfect, a very well made movie!"
Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."
Samjhana K,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024",Phenomenal! Worth the wait.
Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."
Mundo C,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","BEST movie ever, absolutely all were perfect"
Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."
,4.0,"Sep 17, 2024",I would say I don't think I enjoyed it to the level everyone else did. But I sure as heck had a great time. I think it's a fun movie and see why everyone likes it so much.
Ted P,5.0,"Sep 11, 2024",in 4D It was like being in the plane ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

9/10"
Suicide N,0.5,"Sep 6, 2024",I have never checked a movie 6 times to see how much longer the torture world continue.  Not memorable at all and quite boring.

Jason Loves W,4.0,"Sep 5, 2024","One of the best movie ever made. I feel like this sequel is came out right on time and far better than original movie, which is good. Tom Cruise is terrific in this movie. The final dogfight scene is thrilling and look so realistic. All cast are great."

Takushi Y,3.0,"Aug 31, 2024","prime, 6.8.30
ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

THOMAS M R,5.0,"Aug 18, 2024","A true sequel to the original and a tremendous way to pass the torch to the next generation. lots of big action, shirtless sports, and F-14s vs Su-57s!"
Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."
Rosana B,2.5,"Aug 17, 2024","Assisti com nojinho e desprezo, toda admiração pela beleza e talento de Tom Cruise dão lugar a perplexidade a cada dia de um novo 'escândalo', desculpe me, mas não consigo separar o pessoal do profissional quando se trata de abandono parental, menos encantada ao descobrir o que uma religião (Cientologia?!?!) pode ser tão destrutiva ao ponto de separa um pai de sua filha, e os filhos de uma mãe, triste… Filme chatinho, conforme minha enorme má vontade para com ele.."

,4.5,"Aug 10, 2024","This film is a legacy sequel that brings back Cruise's Maverick to prepare new hotshot pilots for their toughest and most dangerous mission yet. Overall due to the flashbacks and homages to the original, tense flight sequences, stunning visuals, and a stellar ensemble cast this is a movie that will have you hanging onto the edge of your seat until it's climatic end."

Jay W,5.0,"Jul 25, 2024","Fantastically thrilling watch. Filled with old school action and nostalgia, from the story to the the cinematography. Great watch if you're looking for 'the good old days'."
Emma F,5.0,"Jul 21, 2024",I absolutely hate plane movies or anything like them but even as someone who only watches dog movies this caught my attention and I enjoyed it! Definitely surprised me and is well worth a try!
Dustie H,4.5,"Jul 21, 2024",I’ve always loved the first Top Gun. Maverick is even better!
Ace N,4.0,"Jul 21, 2024",Great movie with top quality action shots!
King C,5.0,"Jul 20, 2024","This movie shows tom cruise mentoring a group of upcoming pilots to carry out a mission of destroying an enemy base, this movie is engaging and definetley worth watching if and when you have time!"

(May part 3 be follow suit.)"
bill r,5.0,"Jul 16, 2024",one of the best movie i have ever watched superb script and acting
Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."
Nathan H,5.0,"Jul 12, 2024",This movie makes me proud to be an American!
David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."
smg A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2024","“I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to TOPGUN.”

One of the best movies I have ever seen and the best Tom cruise movie I have seen I wish I saw this in theaters but was to busy when it came out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time just like the first watch I have to rewatch the original because it’s been a couple of years since I’ve seen the original but I really loved this one. 10/10"

The mission completion and the life and death situation is palpable! Huge fan of Tom Cruise after this movie! The man is an acting genius!
Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Simone C,4.0,"Jun 21, 2024","Eh, it was ok. With Tom Cruise being in it though, I was expecting way more precision in the flight scenes. Instead there were turns that made no sense, G forces that made no sense and had no end, it was a bit ridiculous... Still ok though."
Joshua S. I,5.0,"Jun 19, 2024",Finally! A great flick where I don’t feel like I’m getting preached at the entire time!

Sam D,5.0,"Jun 15, 2024","Wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Seemed to capture the spirit of the first movie - and had a certain 90s charm to it.
Tom Cruise is just the consummate movie star.
May watch it again. Excellent."
Paul D,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024","What a film, hooked from start to finish"
N M,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024",So good. So rewatchable. Thanks Tom Cruise for temporarily saving Hollywood.
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing

Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Craig H,5.0,"Jun 5, 2025","Saw this in the cinema three times three years ago and wanted to see how it held up and f***ing hell its still an unbelievable film, probably my favourite movie of the last 5 years and in my top 10 of all time easily. Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

morey d,5.0,"Mar 24, 2025",Absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Riveting story and action packed. Stunts are insane and everything keeps you on the edge of your seat.

MARK C,5.0,"Mar 23, 2025",Amazing! Jaw dropping aerial combat cinematography!
Frans B,5.0,"Mar 22, 2025","How times have changed... Makes me wonder how the original got rated at half this score, but anywhooooo ... This is a whole new level and probably will never be attempted again, or copied in any way, like Tom Cruise said. True that. Undoubtedly the best of the 2, naturally, but as is comparing apples to oranges. This one is in a whole new universe. Worth watching at least 5 times, or more ..."

Fenomenal!!

----

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"
prawnda s,2.5,"Jan 9, 2025","i cannot deny that this is a technically impressive film. at the same time, i dont know how they managed to make fighter jet combat so boring."
,5.0,"Jan 9, 2025","Amazing film and a worthy successor to the original. You don't see a film like this these days and it's such a refreshing breath of fresh air. Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."
Desmond N,5.0,"Jan 8, 2025",10 out of 10 amazing women specially viola Davis
W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro! O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."

,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Movie of the Year 2022

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Nolan S,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Probably best movie I have ever seen, absolute Cinema"
Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."
Samjhana K,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024",Phenomenal! Worth the wait.
Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."
Mundo C,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","BEST movie ever, absolutely all were perfect"
Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Ted P,5.0,"Sep 11, 2024",in 4D It was like being in the plane ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

9/10"
Suicide N,0.5,"Sep 6, 2024",I have never checked a movie 6 times to see how much longer the torture world continue.  Not memorable at all and quite boring.

Jason Loves W,4.0,"Sep 5, 2024","One of the best movie ever made. I feel like this sequel is came out right on time and far better than original movie, which is good. Tom Cruise is terrific in this movie. The final dogfight scene is thrilling and look so realistic. All cast are great."

Takushi Y,3.0,"Aug 31, 2024","prime, 6.8.30
ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."
Rosana B,2.5,"Aug 17, 2024","Assisti com nojinho e desprezo, toda admiração pela beleza e talento de Tom Cruise dão lugar a perplexidade a cada dia de um novo 'escândalo', desculpe me, mas não consigo separar o pessoal do profissional quando se trata de abandono parental, menos encantada ao descobrir o que uma religião (Cientologia?!?!) pode ser tão destrutiva ao ponto de separa um pai de sua filha, e os filhos de uma mãe, triste… Filme chatinho, conforme minha enorme má vontade para com ele.."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."
Nathan H,5.0,"Jul 12, 2024",This movie makes me proud to be an American!
David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."

Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."

So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.

A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."

This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."

Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."

Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Steve W,5.0,"May 27, 2025",Amazing! Perfect in every way! Much better than the original in almost every way! Definitely must see!
Ozbej M,5.0,"May 25, 2025",Just a great legacy sequel and also a phenomenal movie. It's easily one of the best movies of 2020s. 10/10
Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!
,5.0,"May 20, 2025","From the soundtrack to the film, this movie was a delight."
Brayden G,5.0,"May 16, 2025",Way better than the first one I saw this in the theaters when it came out so intense in the Theaters it’s so good on the biggest screen possible
Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rated PG-13 for Some Strong Language and Sequences of Intense Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $718,500,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!
Brochaco J,5.0,"Apr 29, 2025",Great mvoew i was very pleased with ts
Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."

Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure.

Caleb S,5.0,"Dec 21, 2024","A American made masterpiece. Filled with an amazing story and gripping stunts, top gun maverick will go down as one of the best movies in the last decade."

Abubakar B. S,5.0,"Dec 16, 2024",This is the best movie of 2022. The action is out of this world. Tom Cruise did a good job. Kudos. I have watched it more than 5 times.
Kauã M,5.0,"Dec 15, 2024","Simply flawless, a film that promised nothing and delivered everything and more, every aspect raised to the highest possible quality, I waited a long time to see this film and it was worth every second of the incredible experience."
Brenda,4.5,"Dec 15, 2024",Exceptional film. Great performances. Action & storytelling have you on the edge of your seat. The best soundtrack. Highly recommend this movie
Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."
Samjhana K,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024",Phenomenal! Worth the wait.
Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."
Mundo C,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","BEST movie ever, absolutely all were perfect"
Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

Felipe F,5.0,"May 28, 2024",Conseguiram passar por cima do Top Gun de 1986 e deixaram a história impecável.
Kiah B,5.0,"May 25, 2024","Stress inducing, but in a good way."
Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

Joel K,4.5,"May 2, 2024",This movie is the best sequel I ever seen.
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing

Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Frans B,5.0,"Mar 22, 2025","How times have changed... Makes me wonder how the original got rated at half this score, but anywhooooo ... This is a whole new level and probably will never be attempted again, or copied in any way, like Tom Cruise said. True that. Undoubtedly the best of the 2, naturally, but as is comparing apples to oranges. This one is in a whole new universe. Worth watching at least 5 times, or more ..."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"
prawnda s,2.5,"Jan 9, 2025","i cannot deny that this is a technically impressive film. at the same time, i dont know how they managed to make fighter jet combat so boring."

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."
Desmond N,5.0,"Jan 8, 2025",10 out of 10 amazing women specially viola Davis
W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro!

,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Movie of the Year 2022

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."
,4.0,"Sep 17, 2024",I would say I don't think I enjoyed it to the level everyone else did. But I sure as heck had a great time. I think it's a fun movie and see why everyone likes it so much.

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

9/10"
Suicide N,0.5,"Sep 6, 2024",I have never checked a movie 6 times to see how much longer the torture world continue.  Not memorable at all and quite boring.
Vanessa S,5.0,"Sep 6, 2024",Loved it all the way! Even better than Top Gun.  Awesome!
Jason Loves W,4.0,"Sep 5, 2024","One of the best movie ever made. I feel like this sequel is came out right on time and far better than original movie, which is good. Tom Cruise is terrific in this movie. The final dogfight scene is thrilling and look so realistic. All cast are great."

,4.5,"Sep 1, 2024",I was prepared to not like this movie before i saw it. It's  a great sequel and a solid movie by itself. I highly recommend.
Takushi Y,3.0,"Aug 31, 2024","prime, 6.8.30
ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."
Rosana B,2.5,"Aug 17, 2024","Assisti com nojinho e desprezo, toda admiração pela beleza e talento de Tom Cruise dão lugar a perplexidade a cada dia de um novo 'escândalo', desculpe me, mas não consigo separar o pessoal do profissional quando se trata de abandono parental, menos encantada ao descobrir o que uma religião (Cientologia?!?!) pode ser tão destrutiva ao ponto de separa um pai de sua filha, e os filhos de uma mãe, triste… Filme chatinho, conforme minha enorme má vontade para com ele.."

Overall due to the flashbacks and homages to the original, tense flight sequences, stunning visuals, and a stellar ensemble cast this is a movie that will have you hanging onto the edge of your seat until it's climatic end."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."
Nathan H,5.0,"Jul 12, 2024",This movie makes me proud to be an American!
David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."

Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."

So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.

I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."

The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals.

Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."

Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"

Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet.

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."
smg A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2024","“I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to TOPGUN.”

One of the best movies I have ever seen and the best Tom cruise movie I have seen I wish I saw this in theaters but was to busy when it came out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time just like the first watch I have to rewatch the original because it’s been a couple of years since I’ve seen the original but I really loved this one. 10/10"

The mission completion and the life and death situation is palpable! Huge fan of Tom Cruise after this movie! The man is an acting genius!
Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Simone C,4.0,"Jun 21, 2024","Eh, it was ok. With Tom Cruise being in it though, I was expecting way more precision in the flight scenes. Instead there were turns that made no sense, G forces that made no sense and had no end, it was a bit ridiculous... Still ok though."
Joshua S. I,5.0,"Jun 19, 2024",Finally! A great flick where I don’t feel like I’m getting preached at the entire time!

Jonathan S,4.5,"Jun 18, 2024","It has the all the nostalgia from the Top Gun, maybe a little too much.

Sam D,5.0,"Jun 15, 2024","Wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Seemed to capture the spirit of the first movie - and had a certain 90s charm to it.
Tom Cruise is just the consummate movie star.
May watch it again. Excellent."
Paul D,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024","What a film, hooked from start to finish"
N M,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024",So good. So rewatchable. Thanks Tom Cruise for temporarily saving Hollywood.
Jimmy  D,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",I was not sure how a sequel so many years later would be especially in todays age. But i was pleasantly surprised and it was Great.
Owen G,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me in every possible way. Top Gun Maverick is an absolute gem.
OSCAR P,0.5,"Jun 12, 2024",I worked with these A/C on the flightline back in the day. This movie portrays NOTHING in reality.

Matthew S,4.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Great special effects, Tom was good as the aging top gun educating the new generation. Casting just so so."
Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

Joel K,4.5,"May 2, 2024",This movie is the best sequel I ever seen.
Carter C.,5.0,"May 1, 2024","With undeniably hyper-thrilling flight scenes and performances more powerful than the original could ever be, Maverick has humor and emotion that’ll somehow make any viewer cry and cheer simultaneously."

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."

its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."

Mark F,3.5,"Mar 31, 2024",I was surprised by good character development.  It does have a bit of absurd moments at the beginning and end.  Good popcorn flick.
RedStripeZoom,5.0,"Mar 31, 2024","This is a sequel done right, such a memorable time seeing this in the cinema."
Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"

David H,4.5,"Mar 25, 2024","I enjoyed this more than the original film. Great action flick, full of cheese and machismo. Movies like this hardly get made anymore."

I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!

Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."
Patryk S,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Perfect movie, one of a few when second movie is better than first one."
Josh,5.0,"Jul 7, 2025",Instant classic. Absolute cinema!
Winderson N,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",It was an amazing experience watching TOP GUN Maverick. This movie is a masterpiece of cinema!
Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!
,5.0,"May 20, 2025","From the soundtrack to the film, this movie was a delight."
Brayden G,5.0,"May 16, 2025",Way better than the first one I saw this in the theaters when it came out so intense in the Theaters it’s so good on the biggest screen possible
Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."
,5.0,"May 14, 2025",“It’s what my dad would’ve done”
Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rated PG-13 for Some Strong Language and Sequences of Intense Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $718,500,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!
Brochaco J,5.0,"Apr 29, 2025",Great mvoew i was very pleased with ts
Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."
conan t,5.0,"Jun 27, 2024",Now that’s a movie!  It’s got everything you would expect done brilliantly.  Love it!

Simone C,4.0,"Jun 21, 2024","Eh, it was ok. With Tom Cruise being in it though, I was expecting way more precision in the flight scenes. Instead there were turns that made no sense, G forces that made no sense and had no end, it was a bit ridiculous... Still ok though."
Joshua S. I,5.0,"Jun 19, 2024",Finally! A great flick where I don’t feel like I’m getting preached at the entire time!
Ken T,5.0,"Jun 19, 2024",It really doesn’t get any better than this!  Worth the wait!
,2.0,"Jun 18, 2024",Not enough world building in my opinion
Jonathan S,4.5,"Jun 18, 2024","It has the all the nostalgia from the Top Gun, maybe a little too much.
Sometimes it feels frame by frame, until you get to the final act, which I can say it quite an achievement. 4.5/5"
Mike S,5.0,"Jun 17, 2024","What a ride! I was not expecting to enjoy this film, but it truly embodies what it means to be in the cinema and enjoy the experience. The writing, music, acting, and pacing is all impeccable."
Jason O,4.0,"Jun 17, 2024",1st Top Gun was better but I like the new take and the storyline. a good movie to see.

,5.0,"Jun 16, 2024","Finally we get a sequel and unlike most sequels this was just as good at the original.
Well written, acted and directed."

Sam D,5.0,"Jun 15, 2024","Wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Seemed to capture the spirit of the first movie - and had a certain 90s charm to it.
Tom Cruise is just the consummate movie star.
May watch it again. Excellent."
Paul D,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024","What a film, hooked from start to finish"
N M,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024",So good. So rewatchable. Thanks Tom Cruise for temporarily saving Hollywood.
Jimmy  D,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",I was not sure how a sequel so many years later would be especially in todays age. But i was pleasantly surprised and it was Great.
Owen G,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me in every possible way. Top Gun Maverick is an absolute gem.
OSCAR P,0.5,"Jun 12, 2024",I worked with these A/C on the flightline back in the day. This movie portrays NOTHING in reality.

Leroy P,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Incredible viewing, you really felt you were in the cockpit feeling what the pilots were going through"
Rebecca D,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024","This is the best movie in the world. I watched this movie before the original Top Gun, but still. Tom Cruise does amazing in his role as Maverick."
Matthew S,4.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Great special effects, Tom was good as the aging top gun educating the new generation. Casting just so so."
Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

Kiah B,5.0,"May 25, 2024","Stress inducing, but in a good way."
Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."
Fábio e,5.0,"May 4, 2024",Filme excelente. Execução espetacular 10/10
Joel K,4.5,"May 2, 2024",This movie is the best sequel I ever seen.
Carter C.,5.0,"May 1, 2024","With undeniably hyper-thrilling flight scenes and performances more powerful than the original could ever be, Maverick has humor and emotion that’ll somehow make any viewer cry and cheer simultaneously."

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."

its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."
Christine C,5.0,"Apr 11, 2024","Might actually be the best movie I've ever watched.   Loved it, even the cheesy parts."
Iroo M,5.0,"Apr 11, 2024","Amazing story filled with excellent action, Top Gun: Maverick is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Great work for all actors, directors, staffs, etc."

David B,2.0,"Apr 1, 2024","Did not like the first top gun,and top gun 2 is just as bad very over the top American bullshit,bar scenes embarrassing to watch,tom cruise is good,but sorry it was same story as before,glad I did not pay to see this"
Mark F,3.5,"Mar 31, 2024",I was surprised by good character development.  It does have a bit of absurd moments at the beginning and end.  Good popcorn flick.
RedStripeZoom,5.0,"Mar 31, 2024","This is a sequel done right, such a memorable time seeing this in the cinema."
Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"
Eran A,5.0,"Mar 26, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
David H,4.5,"Mar 25, 2024","I enjoyed this more than the original film. Great action flick, full of cheese and machismo. Movies like this hardly get made anymore."
A,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","I wasn't expecting this to be good.. I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!
Huw J,2.0,"Mar 23, 2024","Just watched some of thus on TV, Nd turned over after an hour...... it's so boring and cliché ridden."

,0.5,"Mar 12, 2024",It's one of the corniest movies ever made. Honestly a waste of time.
Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."
Anton A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","Straight-forward, fun sequel to Top Gun."
Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."

Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

Relying on so much ""action"" and special effects just is a substitute for better writing and character development - this whole thing is Alpha male, never loses, no matter what even crazy odds against it.

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"

Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."
smg A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2024","“I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to TOPGUN.”

One of the best movies I have ever seen and the best Tom cruise movie I have seen I wish I saw this in theaters but was to busy when it came out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time just like the first watch I have to rewatch the original because it’s been a couple of years since I’ve seen the original but I really loved this one. 10/10"

The mission completion and the life and death situation is palpable! Huge fan of Tom Cruise after this movie! The man is an acting genius!
Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Simone C,4.0,"Jun 21, 2024","Eh, it was ok. With Tom Cruise being in it though, I was expecting way more precision in the flight scenes. Instead there were turns that made no sense, G forces that made no sense and had no end, it was a bit ridiculous... Still ok though."

Sam D,5.0,"Jun 15, 2024","Wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Seemed to capture the spirit of the first movie - and had a certain 90s charm to it.
Tom Cruise is just the consummate movie star.
May watch it again. Excellent."

Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."

its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."

Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"

I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!

Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."

John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.

Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through.

Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.
Kristoffer Tofte W,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Most importanly good action and beautiful scenery, but also some history behind the characters."
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."
Patryk S,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Perfect movie, one of a few when second movie is better than first one."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Sergio A,5.0,"Jun 19, 2025","I went in without having seen the first film, and wow, what a surprise. It delivers action, romance, friendship, fatherhood, and personal growth. One of the best surprises a blockbuster has ever delivered."

Craig H,5.0,"Jun 5, 2025","Saw this in the cinema three times three years ago and wanted to see how it held up and f***ing hell its still an unbelievable film, probably my favourite movie of the last 5 years and in my top 10 of all time easily. Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Brayden G,5.0,"May 16, 2025",Way better than the first one I saw this in the theaters when it came out so intense in the Theaters it’s so good on the biggest screen possible
Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Frans B,5.0,"Mar 22, 2025","How times have changed... Makes me wonder how the original got rated at half this score, but anywhooooo ... This is a whole new level and probably will never be attempted again, or copied in any way, like Tom Cruise said. True that. Undoubtedly the best of the 2, naturally, but as is comparing apples to oranges. This one is in a whole new universe. Worth watching at least 5 times, or more ..."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"
prawnda s,2.5,"Jan 9, 2025","i cannot deny that this is a technically impressive film. at the same time, i dont know how they managed to make fighter jet combat so boring."

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."
Desmond N,5.0,"Jan 8, 2025",10 out of 10 amazing women specially viola Davis
W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro!

,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Movie of the Year 2022

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."
,4.0,"Sep 17, 2024",I would say I don't think I enjoyed it to the level everyone else did. But I sure as heck had a great time. I think it's a fun movie and see why everyone likes it so much.

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

Suicide N,0.5,"Sep 6, 2024",I have never checked a movie 6 times to see how much longer the torture world continue.  Not memorable at all and quite boring.

Jason Loves W,4.0,"Sep 5, 2024","One of the best movie ever made. I feel like this sequel is came out right on time and far better than original movie, which is good. Tom Cruise is terrific in this movie. The final dogfight scene is thrilling and look so realistic. All cast are great."

,4.5,"Sep 1, 2024",I was prepared to not like this movie before i saw it. It's  a great sequel and a solid movie by itself. I highly recommend.
Takushi Y,3.0,"Aug 31, 2024","prime, 6.8.30
ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."
Rosana B,2.5,"Aug 17, 2024","Assisti com nojinho e desprezo, toda admiração pela beleza e talento de Tom Cruise dão lugar a perplexidade a cada dia de um novo 'escândalo', desculpe me, mas não consigo separar o pessoal do profissional quando se trata de abandono parental, menos encantada ao descobrir o que uma religião (Cientologia?!?!) pode ser tão destrutiva ao ponto de separa um pai de sua filha, e os filhos de uma mãe, triste… Filme chatinho, conforme minha enorme má vontade para com ele.."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."
Nathan H,5.0,"Jul 12, 2024",This movie makes me proud to be an American!
David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."

Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."

So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.

A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.

Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"

Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals.

Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."

I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!
Huw J,2.0,"Mar 23, 2024","Just watched some of thus on TV, Nd turned over after an hour...... it's so boring and cliché ridden."
standard-name,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",The movie that remembered what movies were supposed to be about
Enrique,5.0,"Mar 13, 2024",Absolutely Fantastic Movie!
,0.5,"Mar 12, 2024",It's one of the corniest movies ever made. Honestly a waste of time.
Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."
Anton A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","Straight-forward, fun sequel to Top Gun."
Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.
Kristoffer Tofte W,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Most importanly good action and beautiful scenery, but also some history behind the characters."
Dionicio S,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024",Fantastic from start to finish!
Ashlyn C,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","This movie is a real and true cinematic masterpiece. I could watch it again and again and never get bored. The acting and storyline is phenomenal, and it lives up perfectly to the original. A must watch."
Robert R,3.5,"Jan 1, 2024",getting tired of nostalgia pieces. If they were going to make a sequel it should have happened a long time ago.
Richard T,5.0,"Dec 31, 2023",One of the best sequels of all time. Better than original.
erin m,5.0,"Dec 30, 2023","excellent, extremely well done"
daniel r,3.5,"Dec 30, 2023","Great brain candy. 
really enjoyed it turned off my brain and just enjoyed."
B B,4.5,"Dec 30, 2023","The script for the fast & urgent dialogues were insane. Cinematography absolutely spot on. While the happy ending was a nice treat, a more tragic ending would have taken it to 5 stars."
Christopher H,2.0,"Dec 29, 2023","Stupid, one-dimensional drivel, chok full of clichés. TV movie quality acting, at best."
Dani N,4.5,"Dec 29, 2023","Near to be Perfect, The only thing I have been missing is to see the latest generation airplanes. Excellent action scenes, realistic and exciting.
all this mixed with scenes that are a tribute to the first Top Gun."
Alex B,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023",Best blockbuster  movie that I haven't seen in a longtime! Tom Cruise still got it.
Fawzi G,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023","This is if not possibly the greatest movie of all time! It has action, romance, and something to sing along to with the boys."
Qumars R,0.5,"Dec 28, 2023","Penny got a car, devastated"
Rainbow C,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Great movie from start to finish.
Peter V,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Silly and predictable - hero survives, is lauded and gets the girl. Supporting cast is  weak and action takes are not credible. Escapists - enjoy! :)"
Julia M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Absolutely amazing and exciting, best movie of the year!"
Christian S,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Wow! A perfect entertaining movie start to finish!
John M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",* Superb in every way ✨
Dennie v,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie. Story is good but missing some feelings. The original had some great music. Whenever i hear 'great balls of fire' or 'take my breath away' i'll think back to the original movie. Maverick misses this feel good moments.

Great movie but could be better 😘"
Luke G,5.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Arguably, the best follow-up to its predecessor."
Scott C,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023",Truly a masterpiece and how sequels should be done
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."
Patryk S,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Perfect movie, one of a few when second movie is better than first one."
Josh,5.0,"Jul 7, 2025",Instant classic. Absolute cinema!
Winderson N,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",It was an amazing experience watching TOP GUN Maverick. This movie is a masterpiece of cinema!
Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."
B F.,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025",Tom’s really got this action genre figured out I guess.

Patrick H.,5.0,"Jul 3, 2025",It’s an exceptional movie
Tina P.,5.0,"Jul 2, 2025",I really liked this one because it dealt with his repercussions from the first movie. I also like that I didn’t have to sob my eyes out.
Rodolfo U,4.5,"Jul 2, 2025",a love letter to the movies and a very good sequel
Brian B.,5.0,"Jul 1, 2025",It defied my wildest expectations!!! So nice to have a movie made to entertain and not preach.  Loved it!

Push-In G,4.5,"Jun 22, 2025",Cinema
Matt M,5.0,"Jun 21, 2025","TC still got it. Perfect combo of action with a splash of comedy, and romance. Recommend seeing on big screen if possible to really appreciate the sound effects. 10/10"
James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."
Jack G,5.0,"Jun 20, 2025",Absolute CINEMA and the definition of a perfect Blockbuster
Sergio A,5.0,"Jun 19, 2025","I went in without having seen the first film, and wow, what a surprise. It delivers action, romance, friendship, fatherhood, and personal growth. One of the best surprises a blockbuster has ever delivered."
Casper F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2025","must watch, absolute cinema"
Craig H,5.0,"Jun 5, 2025","Saw this in the cinema three times three years ago and wanted to see how it held up and f***ing hell its still an unbelievable film, probably my favourite movie of the last 5 years and in my top 10 of all time easily. Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"
Orpheus K,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025",Simply the Best action movie ever made
Moustafa B,5.0,"May 29, 2025","I love it, I watch it at least once every month"

Roshith B,5.0,"May 27, 2025","No matter some people say that Christopher nolan movies are the best but it's not top gun maverick >> whole Christopher nolan filmography 

Tom Cruise he's the only star on the planet who let audience to big screens after his retirement it's better stop watching scrap lag Hollywood films"
Tommy & Naomi N,5.0,"May 27, 2025","Favorite film of all time. Nostalgic, simple, and thoroughly enjoyable."
Ben,5.0,"May 27, 2025",Loved this movie!! Just as good as the first one!
Steve W,5.0,"May 27, 2025",Amazing! Perfect in every way! Much better than the original in almost every way! Definitely must see!
Ozbej M,5.0,"May 25, 2025",Just a great legacy sequel and also a phenomenal movie. It's easily one of the best movies of 2020s. 10/10
Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!
,5.0,"May 20, 2025","From the soundtrack to the film, this movie was a delight."
Brayden G,5.0,"May 16, 2025",Way better than the first one I saw this in the theaters when it came out so intense in the Theaters it’s so good on the biggest screen possible
Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.
Stephen C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Tom, I find you funny in movie theaters, your movie is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a compliment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 11 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rated PG-13 for Some Strong Language and Sequences of Intense Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $718,500,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.

Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D

The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."
,4.0,"Sep 17, 2024",I would say I don't think I enjoyed it to the level everyone else did. But I sure as heck had a great time. I think it's a fun movie and see why everyone likes it so much.

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."

This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."
Yuki O,4.5,"Jun 1, 2024",2回見ました。迫力すごい。トムクルーズイケメン。

Felipe F,5.0,"May 28, 2024",Conseguiram passar por cima do Top Gun de 1986 e deixaram a história impecável.
Kiah B,5.0,"May 25, 2024","Stress inducing, but in a good way."
Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."
Fábio e,5.0,"May 4, 2024",Filme excelente. Execução espetacular 10/10
Joel K,4.5,"May 2, 2024",This movie is the best sequel I ever seen.
Carter C.,5.0,"May 1, 2024","With undeniably hyper-thrilling flight scenes and performances more powerful than the original could ever be, Maverick has humor and emotion that’ll somehow make any viewer cry and cheer simultaneously."
Kyle M,3.5,"Apr 27, 2024",Serviceable action movie. Don't get the hype.

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."
CONNIE,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024",this was really good I enjoyed it with the husband
R Z,2.0,"Apr 21, 2024",It insists upon itself.
Ronald E,5.0,"Apr 14, 2024",Stellar movie. Packed with action ripe with references to the original top gun. And it has Tom Cruise. Top 3 movie of all times. Seriously!

Cheryl D,5.0,"Apr 12, 2024","just wow everything about this film is superb from the flight scenes to tom cruise 
its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."
Christine C,5.0,"Apr 11, 2024","Might actually be the best movie I've ever watched.   Loved it, even the cheesy parts."
Iroo M,5.0,"Apr 11, 2024","Amazing story filled with excellent action, Top Gun: Maverick is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Great work for all actors, directors, staffs, etc."
,4.5,"Apr 9, 2024","Great sequel - overall good story line, good action - a little over the top but would rather than that underwhelming. Plus they left us hanging for a long time to get this."
David B,2.0,"Apr 1, 2024","Did not like the first top gun,and top gun 2 is just as bad very over the top American bullshit,bar scenes embarrassing to watch,tom cruise is good,but sorry it was same story as before,glad I did not pay to see this"
Mark F,3.5,"Mar 31, 2024",I was surprised by good character development.  It does have a bit of absurd moments at the beginning and end.  Good popcorn flick.
RedStripeZoom,5.0,"Mar 31, 2024","This is a sequel done right, such a memorable time seeing this in the cinema."
Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"
Eran A,5.0,"Mar 26, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
David H,4.5,"Mar 25, 2024","I enjoyed this more than the original film. Great action flick, full of cheese and machismo. Movies like this hardly get made anymore."
A,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","I wasn't expecting this to be good.. I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!
Huw J,2.0,"Mar 23, 2024","Just watched some of thus on TV, Nd turned over after an hour...... it's so boring and cliché ridden."

Enrique,5.0,"Mar 13, 2024",Absolutely Fantastic Movie!
,0.5,"Mar 12, 2024",It's one of the corniest movies ever made. Honestly a waste of time.
Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."
Anton A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","Straight-forward, fun sequel to Top Gun."
Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.
Kristoffer Tofte W,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Most importanly good action and beautiful scenery, but also some history behind the characters."
Dionicio S,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024",Fantastic from start to finish!
Ashlyn C,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","This movie is a real and true cinematic masterpiece. I could watch it again and again and never get bored. The acting and storyline is phenomenal, and it lives up perfectly to the original. A must watch."
Robert R,3.5,"Jan 1, 2024",getting tired of nostalgia pieces. If they were going to make a sequel it should have happened a long time ago.
Richard T,5.0,"Dec 31, 2023",One of the best sequels of all time. Better than original.
erin m,5.0,"Dec 30, 2023","excellent, extremely well done"
daniel r,3.5,"Dec 30, 2023","Great brain candy. 
really enjoyed it turned off my brain and just enjoyed."
B B,4.5,"Dec 30, 2023","The script for the fast & urgent dialogues were insane. Cinematography absolutely spot on. While the happy ending was a nice treat, a more tragic ending would have taken it to 5 stars."
Christopher H,2.0,"Dec 29, 2023","Stupid, one-dimensional drivel, chok full of clichés. TV movie quality acting, at best."
Dani N,4.5,"Dec 29, 2023","Near to be Perfect, The only thing I have been missing is to see the latest generation airplanes. Excellent action scenes, realistic and exciting.
all this mixed with scenes that are a tribute to the first Top Gun."
Alex B,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023",Best blockbuster  movie that I haven't seen in a longtime! Tom Cruise still got it.
Fawzi G,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023","This is if not possibly the greatest movie of all time! It has action, romance, and something to sing along to with the boys."
Qumars R,0.5,"Dec 28, 2023","Penny got a car, devastated"
Rainbow C,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Great movie from start to finish.
Peter V,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Silly and predictable - hero survives, is lauded and gets the girl. Supporting cast is  weak and action takes are not credible. Escapists - enjoy! :)"
Julia M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Absolutely amazing and exciting, best movie of the year!"
Christian S,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Wow! A perfect entertaining movie start to finish!
John M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",* Superb in every way ✨
Dennie v,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie. Story is good but missing some feelings. The original had some great music. Whenever i hear 'great balls of fire' or 'take my breath away' i'll think back to the original movie. Maverick misses this feel good moments.

Great movie but could be better 😘"
Luke G,5.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Arguably, the best follow-up to its predecessor."
Scott C,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023",Truly a masterpiece and how sequels should be done
Newton C,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","Fantastic, lots of action and great fun, especially for those who like planes. Incredible images. Wonderful shots. Great film to sit back, relax and have fun. In my opinion, it was better than the first one, which was already very good."
Karthik R,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023","Absolute entertainment!! Goes to show just why movies are made and people flock to the theatres. Amazing direction, Superbly hooky script, dialogues are heart wrenching, and the goose bumps come and stay! Bruckhiemer and Tom Cruise have once again, marvelled in the art of film making to show studios and production houses alike, that this is how it should be done! Respect!!"
Clover G,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible and most definitely the best movie of the year. It is inspiring, extremely heart touching and will have you in an array of emotions throughout its duration. The acting is also very good, with great performances from its lead actors. Must watch!"
Matheus A,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023","In an era of very digital action films, this sequel to the 80s classic is a relief and a gift!"
Tyson S,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023",Good old fashioned action packed cinema. Seldom does as sequel top the original movie but Top Gun Maverick manages this in every aspect! Hands down one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
Jamie S,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023","10/10
Surprisingly, one of the best movies of 2022.

9/10 for me is being happy to pay for it at a movie theatre and I saw it twice, so 10/10.

I own it and still pop it on once in a while because it's a movie that keeps you engaged, light and easy to follow while still giving you great moments."
BB I,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023",Old school movie. One of the most enjoyable for quite sometime.
,4.5,"Dec 22, 2023",Much better than the first film
David,4.5,"Dec 21, 2023","Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this sequel is at the same level as the original. It kept my eyes on the screen and held my attention well like all great movies do. The action sequences are exciting to watch. The fun ended too soon for me."
Dylan  R,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",I thought it was very intense.
adrianne,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",its literally so good!! lots of action
Emilliano Jr S,3.0,"Dec 18, 2023",An overated sequel with a slight improvement from the 80's classic.
Cinebuff H,5.0,"Dec 15, 2023","I was born in 89' so I had no idea of Top Gun the original until early mid 90's when Hip Hop songs would reference it and maybe I'd see it somewhere else in pop culture. I say that to say, I watched Maverick with zero context of the past, just let the movie play out on its own with no preconceived notion for what it had to live up to, and it was awesome. I missed the boat of watching it theaters, life happens. Finally watched it, but at home, with a proper 5.1 surround sound and it delivered with the visuals, sfx, and finally acting of course. Every actor came through for their characters, from the OG Hollywood names to the new ones, it all came full circle in a meta kind of way to see them tell the story of time passing. Visually this film delivered in truly putting you into the action. Tom Cruise really shined and brought out the best around him and vice versa. This is going to be my new Christmas movie simply because there's snow, that counts right? Watch and rewatch it! Do yourself a favor and get a quality surround sound, films like these deserve to be played with quality sub woofers."
Chris D,3.5,"Dec 14, 2023","it is Entertaining, the flight sequences are really good. but some of the realism gets me on some of the scenes. but over all it is a good show."
Kevin M,5.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Loved it. Tom Cruise nailed it again.
Melchizedek Franz Noval S,5.0,"Dec 8, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick is an absolute must-see film of 2022, which is a thrill-ride for an outstanding blockbuster to an incredible journey filled with friendship, passion and loyalty. With a great cinematography, visual effects, and a successful acting career for Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell."
Drew A,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023",Great movie and soundtrack! Classic!
Muhammad Aniq Z,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023","""Top Gun: Maverick"" is totally epic! The flying scenes are insane, and Tom Cruise as Maverick is still super cool. It's like a mix of old-school vibes and crazy new graphics. The whole training scene is intense, and Maverick's character gets even more awesome. They bring in new pilots too, which is pretty cool. The story is kinda easy to anticipate, but who cares when the movie is this much fun? It's like a high-flying tribute to the classic, and you don't wanna miss the ride! Totally would recommend it for a blockbuster movie night with friends!"
St R,5.0,"Dec 6, 2023","I have a running top 10-ish list of movies I love. It's been a LONG time since a new one shot right up high on that list! This film does everything right! It's a US military movie, some will hate that but screw them. No shoehorned social agendas. This is a movie about excellence and service and sacrifice, it's about warriors and what they'll put on the line for each other. And it's about how relationships are what really make us come alive; having someone TO fight FOR is what really matters in the end."
eddiesut13,5.0,"Dec 5, 2023",It's a fun movie to watch. Big visuals and classic songs. A little cheesey at times. Overall what a movie should be. And the third act didn't completely suck like a lot of movies these days.
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Craig H,5.0,"Jun 5, 2025","Saw this in the cinema three times three years ago and wanted to see how it held up and f***ing hell its still an unbelievable film, probably my favourite movie of the last 5 years and in my top 10 of all time easily. Pretty much movie blockbuster perfection, cant fault it."
Robert M,5.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I thought there was no way this sequel could stand up to the original, and boy was I wrong. Not only does is stand up to one of my all-time favorites, but dare I say that it surpasses the first film! Well done!!!"

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

Frans B,5.0,"Mar 22, 2025","How times have changed... Makes me wonder how the original got rated at half this score, but anywhooooo ... This is a whole new level and probably will never be attempted again, or copied in any way, like Tom Cruise said. True that. Undoubtedly the best of the 2, naturally, but as is comparing apples to oranges. This one is in a whole new universe. Worth watching at least 5 times, or more ..."

Fenomenal!!

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality. Especially the visual and sound qualities of the film. Every audiovisual aspect is simply perfect and anyone who saw it in the cinema (preferably in a good cinema) was able to experience what it's like to fly a fighter jet. Phenomenal!!"
Cameron H,5.0,"Mar 2, 2025","A perfect movie in my opinion because it has all the elements that make a movie great: great acting, cinematography, thrilling action and suspense, romance, humor, interesting characters, an engaging story, and emotional moments. A perfect summer blockbuster."

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

この映画は、息を呑むような空中戦シーンと、緻密に描かれた人間ドラマが見事に融合しています。特に、最新の撮影技術を駆使したリアルな空中戦は、観る者をまるでコックピットにいるかのような臨場感へと誘います。これにより、観客はスクリーンに釘付けとなり、手に汗握る体験を味わうことができます。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"
prawnda s,2.5,"Jan 9, 2025","i cannot deny that this is a technically impressive film. at the same time, i dont know how they managed to make fighter jet combat so boring."
,5.0,"Jan 9, 2025","Amazing film and a worthy successor to the original. You don't see a film like this these days and it's such a refreshing breath of fresh air. Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."
Desmond N,5.0,"Jan 8, 2025",10 out of 10 amazing women specially viola Davis
W. Scott S,5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is tied with Edge of Tomorrow as my two all-time favorite Tom Cruise movies and probably in my top 10 or 20 all-time movies period.
Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."
Felipe b,5.0,"Jan 6, 2025","Acho fantástico que esse filme não tem aqueles clichê de briga de bar, briga das principais rivalidade é um filme de não necessita disso pra mostra que o protagonista é alguém muito maneiro! O filme tem muitas cenas muito boas e sua história muito marcante e única sem passar a mão na cabeça do protagonista e dos demais,Top gun é será um filme marcante na minha vida e de muitos com seu elenco de peso e sua história que aproveita cada um do tanto que precisa ser usado 10/10."

,5.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Movie of the Year 2022

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Nolan S,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Probably best movie I have ever seen, absolute Cinema"
Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."
Chloe  _,4.5,"Dec 23, 2024",I mean wow. Did not think it could be better than the original but the plot and development are just stunning. Really makes you feel something.

Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Morghen V,5.0,"Nov 4, 2024",This movie is incredible. If you haven’t seen it you’re missing out
Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.
max e,5.0,"Oct 20, 2024",Best movie of 2022 with great action
Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."
Samjhana K,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024",Phenomenal! Worth the wait.
Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."
,4.0,"Sep 17, 2024",I would say I don't think I enjoyed it to the level everyone else did. But I sure as heck had a great time. I think it's a fun movie and see why everyone likes it so much.

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

9/10"
Suicide N,0.5,"Sep 6, 2024",I have never checked a movie 6 times to see how much longer the torture world continue.  Not memorable at all and quite boring.

Jason Loves W,4.0,"Sep 5, 2024","One of the best movie ever made. I feel like this sequel is came out right on time and far better than original movie, which is good. Tom Cruise is terrific in this movie. The final dogfight scene is thrilling and look so realistic. All cast are great."

,4.5,"Sep 1, 2024",I was prepared to not like this movie before i saw it. It's  a great sequel and a solid movie by itself. I highly recommend.
Takushi Y,3.0,"Aug 31, 2024","prime, 6.8.30
ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"
PH N,5.0,"Aug 30, 2024","Wonderful writing, good acting, breathtaking visual effects. It's an awesome takeover for the franchise. It will make you want to watch more of it."

THOMAS M R,5.0,"Aug 18, 2024","A true sequel to the original and a tremendous way to pass the torch to the next generation. lots of big action, shirtless sports, and F-14s vs Su-57s!"
Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."
Rosana B,2.5,"Aug 17, 2024","Assisti com nojinho e desprezo, toda admiração pela beleza e talento de Tom Cruise dão lugar a perplexidade a cada dia de um novo 'escândalo', desculpe me, mas não consigo separar o pessoal do profissional quando se trata de abandono parental, menos encantada ao descobrir o que uma religião (Cientologia?!?!) pode ser tão destrutiva ao ponto de separa um pai de sua filha, e os filhos de uma mãe, triste… Filme chatinho, conforme minha enorme má vontade para com ele.."

,4.5,"Aug 10, 2024","This film is a legacy sequel that brings back Cruise's Maverick to prepare new hotshot pilots for their toughest and most dangerous mission yet. Overall due to the flashbacks and homages to the original, tense flight sequences, stunning visuals, and a stellar ensemble cast this is a movie that will have you hanging onto the edge of your seat until it's climatic end."

bill r,5.0,"Jul 16, 2024",one of the best movie i have ever watched superb script and acting
Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."
Nathan H,5.0,"Jul 12, 2024",This movie makes me proud to be an American!
David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."
ahsen k,3.0,"Jul 8, 2024","Its a good drama movie but the film lacked action like in the first movie
an actual dog fight  that was intensive."
smg A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2024","“I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to TOPGUN.”

One of the best movies I have ever seen and the best Tom cruise movie I have seen I wish I saw this in theaters but was to busy when it came out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time just like the first watch I have to rewatch the original because it’s been a couple of years since I’ve seen the original but I really loved this one. 10/10"

The mission completion and the life and death situation is palpable! Huge fan of Tom Cruise after this movie! The man is an acting genius!
Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Simone C,4.0,"Jun 21, 2024","Eh, it was ok. With Tom Cruise being in it though, I was expecting way more precision in the flight scenes. Instead there were turns that made no sense, G forces that made no sense and had no end, it was a bit ridiculous... Still ok though."

Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"

The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."

Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."

I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!

standard-name,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",The movie that remembered what movies were supposed to be about
Enrique,5.0,"Mar 13, 2024",Absolutely Fantastic Movie!
,0.5,"Mar 12, 2024",It's one of the corniest movies ever made. Honestly a waste of time.
Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."
Anton A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","Straight-forward, fun sequel to Top Gun."
Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.
Kristoffer Tofte W,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Most importanly good action and beautiful scenery, but also some history behind the characters."
Dionicio S,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024",Fantastic from start to finish!
Ashlyn C,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","This movie is a real and true cinematic masterpiece. I could watch it again and again and never get bored. The acting and storyline is phenomenal, and it lives up perfectly to the original. A must watch."
Robert R,3.5,"Jan 1, 2024",getting tired of nostalgia pieces. If they were going to make a sequel it should have happened a long time ago.
Richard T,5.0,"Dec 31, 2023",One of the best sequels of all time. Better than original.
erin m,5.0,"Dec 30, 2023","excellent, extremely well done"
daniel r,3.5,"Dec 30, 2023","Great brain candy. 
really enjoyed it turned off my brain and just enjoyed."
B B,4.5,"Dec 30, 2023","The script for the fast & urgent dialogues were insane. Cinematography absolutely spot on. While the happy ending was a nice treat, a more tragic ending would have taken it to 5 stars."
Christopher H,2.0,"Dec 29, 2023","Stupid, one-dimensional drivel, chok full of clichés. TV movie quality acting, at best."
Dani N,4.5,"Dec 29, 2023","Near to be Perfect, The only thing I have been missing is to see the latest generation airplanes. Excellent action scenes, realistic and exciting.
all this mixed with scenes that are a tribute to the first Top Gun."
Alex B,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023",Best blockbuster  movie that I haven't seen in a longtime! Tom Cruise still got it.
Fawzi G,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023","This is if not possibly the greatest movie of all time! It has action, romance, and something to sing along to with the boys."
Qumars R,0.5,"Dec 28, 2023","Penny got a car, devastated"
Rainbow C,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Great movie from start to finish.
Peter V,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Silly and predictable - hero survives, is lauded and gets the girl. Supporting cast is  weak and action takes are not credible. Escapists - enjoy! :)"
Julia M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Absolutely amazing and exciting, best movie of the year!"
Christian S,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Wow! A perfect entertaining movie start to finish!
John M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",* Superb in every way ✨
Dennie v,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie. Story is good but missing some feelings. The original had some great music. Whenever i hear 'great balls of fire' or 'take my breath away' i'll think back to the original movie. Maverick misses this feel good moments.

Great movie but could be better 😘"
Luke G,5.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Arguably, the best follow-up to its predecessor."
Scott C,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023",Truly a masterpiece and how sequels should be done
Newton C,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","Fantastic, lots of action and great fun, especially for those who like planes. Incredible images. Wonderful shots. Great film to sit back, relax and have fun. In my opinion, it was better than the first one, which was already very good."
Karthik R,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023","Absolute entertainment!! Goes to show just why movies are made and people flock to the theatres. Amazing direction, Superbly hooky script, dialogues are heart wrenching, and the goose bumps come and stay! Bruckhiemer and Tom Cruise have once again, marvelled in the art of film making to show studios and production houses alike, that this is how it should be done! Respect!!"
Clover G,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible and most definitely the best movie of the year. It is inspiring, extremely heart touching and will have you in an array of emotions throughout its duration. The acting is also very good, with great performances from its lead actors. Must watch!"
Matheus A,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023","In an era of very digital action films, this sequel to the 80s classic is a relief and a gift!"
Tyson S,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023",Good old fashioned action packed cinema. Seldom does as sequel top the original movie but Top Gun Maverick manages this in every aspect! Hands down one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
Jamie S,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023","10/10
Surprisingly, one of the best movies of 2022.

9/10 for me is being happy to pay for it at a movie theatre and I saw it twice, so 10/10.

I own it and still pop it on once in a while because it's a movie that keeps you engaged, light and easy to follow while still giving you great moments."
BB I,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023",Old school movie. One of the most enjoyable for quite sometime.
,4.5,"Dec 22, 2023",Much better than the first film
David,4.5,"Dec 21, 2023","Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this sequel is at the same level as the original. It kept my eyes on the screen and held my attention well like all great movies do. The action sequences are exciting to watch. The fun ended too soon for me."
Dylan  R,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",I thought it was very intense.
adrianne,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",its literally so good!! lots of action
Emilliano Jr S,3.0,"Dec 18, 2023",An overated sequel with a slight improvement from the 80's classic.
Cinebuff H,5.0,"Dec 15, 2023","I was born in 89' so I had no idea of Top Gun the original until early mid 90's when Hip Hop songs would reference it and maybe I'd see it somewhere else in pop culture. I say that to say, I watched Maverick with zero context of the past, just let the movie play out on its own with no preconceived notion for what it had to live up to, and it was awesome. I missed the boat of watching it theaters, life happens. Finally watched it, but at home, with a proper 5.1 surround sound and it delivered with the visuals, sfx, and finally acting of course. Every actor came through for their characters, from the OG Hollywood names to the new ones, it all came full circle in a meta kind of way to see them tell the story of time passing. Visually this film delivered in truly putting you into the action. Tom Cruise really shined and brought out the best around him and vice versa. This is going to be my new Christmas movie simply because there's snow, that counts right? Watch and rewatch it! Do yourself a favor and get a quality surround sound, films like these deserve to be played with quality sub woofers."
Chris D,3.5,"Dec 14, 2023","it is Entertaining, the flight sequences are really good. but some of the realism gets me on some of the scenes. but over all it is a good show."
Kevin M,5.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Loved it. Tom Cruise nailed it again.
Melchizedek Franz Noval S,5.0,"Dec 8, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick is an absolute must-see film of 2022, which is a thrill-ride for an outstanding blockbuster to an incredible journey filled with friendship, passion and loyalty. With a great cinematography, visual effects, and a successful acting career for Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell."
Drew A,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023",Great movie and soundtrack! Classic!
Muhammad Aniq Z,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023","""Top Gun: Maverick"" is totally epic! The flying scenes are insane, and Tom Cruise as Maverick is still super cool. It's like a mix of old-school vibes and crazy new graphics. The whole training scene is intense, and Maverick's character gets even more awesome. They bring in new pilots too, which is pretty cool. The story is kinda easy to anticipate, but who cares when the movie is this much fun? It's like a high-flying tribute to the classic, and you don't wanna miss the ride! Totally would recommend it for a blockbuster movie night with friends!"
St R,5.0,"Dec 6, 2023","I have a running top 10-ish list of movies I love. It's been a LONG time since a new one shot right up high on that list! This film does everything right! It's a US military movie, some will hate that but screw them. No shoehorned social agendas. This is a movie about excellence and service and sacrifice, it's about warriors and what they'll put on the line for each other. And it's about how relationships are what really make us come alive; having someone TO fight FOR is what really matters in the end."
eddiesut13,5.0,"Dec 5, 2023",It's a fun movie to watch. Big visuals and classic songs. A little cheesey at times. Overall what a movie should be. And the third act didn't completely suck like a lot of movies these days.
Schizo V,4.0,"Dec 4, 2023",One of the movies that must be shown in theaters.
,5.0,"Dec 2, 2023","Best combat pilot movie since the original top gun movie. SPOILERS: It finally lays to rest some serious closures from the loss of Goose. I especially love that this pays tribute Val Kilmer. My only fret is the combat mission is very similar to Star Wars A New Hope. Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least. Beg there will be a third movie and wish we had other films with the Top Gun - but this movie fills the soul."
Peter F,2.5,"Dec 1, 2023","Honestly so over movies like this. Actors with way too much makeup on, perfect hair, overly dramatized script, predictable storyline. Bleh. I'd recommend it as a watch just because I'm a cinefile and will watch almost anything once. But I wish Tom Cruise and other Hollywood folks would stop making dumb movies like this."
Benjiboy t,5.0,"Nov 29, 2023",Might be the best movie since Top Gun
Zaya G,5.0,"Nov 27, 2023",Amazing and thrilling moving. Great directing by Joseph Kosinski!
Andy H,5.0,"Nov 22, 2023","Movie of the year ofc, excited to see more!"
Steve D,1.5,"Nov 19, 2023",Fans of the first will find a lot to like but it covers nothing new.
JT H,4.0,"Nov 19, 2023","This movie was pretty solid. I don't think it's as good as most people say, but it's good. The action is amazing, and Tom Cruise is fantastic."
CJ S,1.5,"Nov 18, 2023",Just no. Couldn't get through the first 20 minutes. Boring. Bad acting.
wilson s,5.0,"Nov 17, 2023","It does not matter if you haven't seen the original beforehand, all the information you need is covered very quickly. And while there is a mission and an intriguing plot with twists, the main strength is it's outstanding execution of it's characters. It evaded politics and instead had every character navigate each other's personalities, agendas, and past. The story between Goose's son and Maverick is interesting and by the end, very wholesome. Surprisingly fantastic movie!"
Cullen L,5.0,"Nov 15, 2023",Its a Great movie. One of the best!
Daniel D,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023","like I said at the first movie, bro has beef with the hard deck"
Benjamin E,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",A movie made purely for the purpose of entertainment.  A refreshing change from most movies that being used as a pulpit to lecture audiences about political issues. This one doesn't get political.  People from all walks of life will be entertained and not lectured. No politics in this. It truly is a crowd pleaser
Landon S,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",An absolute cinematic masterpiece
Ray C,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023",Tom Cruises performance was amazing and the roll fits him perfectly. Loved how much everyone is developed and changes throughout the movie. Great cgi
matthias s,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023","Top Gun maverick is an action-packed, high-octane adrenaline rush that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. It's a perfect blend of action, romance, and drama that will have you hooked from start to finish.

Firstly, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. The stunning aerial footage of fighter planes soaring through the sky is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the sound effects will have you feeling like you're right in the middle of the action.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

Top Gun Maverick is a true masterpiece of its genre and a must-watch for any movie lover. It's an epic adventure that will leave you feeling exhilarated and wanting more."
Parker N,5.0,"Nov 8, 2023","I was not alive for then the first one came out so when we saw this second weekend of it coming out, I really loved this movie. It did a good job, without explicitly telling you everything, about what happened in the first, so you don't feel so lost. As someone who never saw the first one, this was a very, very great movie."
Marc Joseph K,5.0,"Nov 6, 2023",Tom Cruise Nailed It!
Chase C,4.5,"Nov 5, 2023","This movie is amazing, and it is WAY better than the original in my opinion. My only issue is that the romance feels pretty forced and it genuinely adds nothing to the movie."
Chris A,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023",Formulaic and predictable and all of that...as well as a total blast. It hit every note just like a great piece of music I want to sing along to. It knew I knew and we still had fun together.
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Pete W,5.0,"May 13, 2025",This is an amazing sequel. Usually the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original but this one definitely lives up to it. We have watched it at least a dozen times.

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Pays respect to the past, has plenty of action, and plenty of heart. The story from the original comes full circle in a very emotionally satisfying way for Maverick, Penny, Rooster (Goose's son), and Iceman after Goose's death in the first film."

Top Gun: Maverick is so much more enjoyable than the original Top Gun.  I can't put my finger on why, but I absolutely loved Maverick and only marginally enjoyed the original.  Maverick was more exciting, more heartfelt, more engaging, and just flat out more lovable."

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."

Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."

Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"

Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

smg A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2024","“I gotta give you your dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters are going to TOPGUN.”

One of the best movies I have ever seen and the best Tom cruise movie I have seen I wish I saw this in theaters but was to busy when it came out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time just like the first watch I have to rewatch the original because it’s been a couple of years since I’ve seen the original but I really loved this one. 10/10"

Keira J,5.0,"Jun 30, 2024",Great acting! Great storyline! Great soundtrack! The movie is absolutely perfect!!! You can FEEL the intensity and emotions of the characters. The mission completion and the life and death situation is palpable! Huge fan of Tom Cruise after this movie! The man is an acting genius!
Richard F,5.0,"Jun 29, 2024","People say 'Fan Service' like it is a negative thing. This movie proves the value of well delivered fan service. As a lifelong fan of the original movie, this sequel gave us everything we could have asked for. Great Dog Fights, they gave us so much character development from Maverick to Ice Man and the gosling. The movie sits with Aliens and Terminator 2 in the hallowed halls of amazing sequels."

Simone C,4.0,"Jun 21, 2024","Eh, it was ok. With Tom Cruise being in it though, I was expecting way more precision in the flight scenes. Instead there were turns that made no sense, G forces that made no sense and had no end, it was a bit ridiculous... Still ok though."
Joshua S. I,5.0,"Jun 19, 2024",Finally! A great flick where I don’t feel like I’m getting preached at the entire time!
Ken T,5.0,"Jun 19, 2024",It really doesn’t get any better than this!  Worth the wait!

Jonathan S,4.5,"Jun 18, 2024","It has the all the nostalgia from the Top Gun, maybe a little too much.
Sometimes it feels frame by frame, until you get to the final act, which I can say it quite an achievement. 4.5/5"

Sam D,5.0,"Jun 15, 2024","Wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Seemed to capture the spirit of the first movie - and had a certain 90s charm to it.
Tom Cruise is just the consummate movie star.
May watch it again. Excellent."
Paul D,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024","What a film, hooked from start to finish"
N M,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024",So good. So rewatchable. Thanks Tom Cruise for temporarily saving Hollywood.
Jimmy  D,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",I was not sure how a sequel so many years later would be especially in todays age. But i was pleasantly surprised and it was Great.
Owen G,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me in every possible way. Top Gun Maverick is an absolute gem.
OSCAR P,0.5,"Jun 12, 2024",I worked with these A/C on the flightline back in the day. This movie portrays NOTHING in reality.

Matthew S,4.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Great special effects, Tom was good as the aging top gun educating the new generation. Casting just so so."
Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

Joel K,4.5,"May 2, 2024",This movie is the best sequel I ever seen.
Carter C.,5.0,"May 1, 2024","With undeniably hyper-thrilling flight scenes and performances more powerful than the original could ever be, Maverick has humor and emotion that’ll somehow make any viewer cry and cheer simultaneously."

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."

its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."

Mark F,3.5,"Mar 31, 2024",I was surprised by good character development.  It does have a bit of absurd moments at the beginning and end.  Good popcorn flick.
RedStripeZoom,5.0,"Mar 31, 2024","This is a sequel done right, such a memorable time seeing this in the cinema."
Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"
Eran A,5.0,"Mar 26, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
David H,4.5,"Mar 25, 2024","I enjoyed this more than the original film. Great action flick, full of cheese and machismo. Movies like this hardly get made anymore."
A,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","I wasn't expecting this to be good.. I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!

Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."

Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.
Kristoffer Tofte W,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Most importanly good action and beautiful scenery, but also some history behind the characters."
Dionicio S,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024",Fantastic from start to finish!
Ashlyn C,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","This movie is a real and true cinematic masterpiece. I could watch it again and again and never get bored. The acting and storyline is phenomenal, and it lives up perfectly to the original. A must watch."
Robert R,3.5,"Jan 1, 2024",getting tired of nostalgia pieces. If they were going to make a sequel it should have happened a long time ago.
Richard T,5.0,"Dec 31, 2023",One of the best sequels of all time. Better than original.

really enjoyed it turned off my brain and just enjoyed."
B B,4.5,"Dec 30, 2023","The script for the fast & urgent dialogues were insane. Cinematography absolutely spot on. While the happy ending was a nice treat, a more tragic ending would have taken it to 5 stars."
Christopher H,2.0,"Dec 29, 2023","Stupid, one-dimensional drivel, chok full of clichés. TV movie quality acting, at best."
Dani N,4.5,"Dec 29, 2023","Near to be Perfect, The only thing I have been missing is to see the latest generation airplanes. Excellent action scenes, realistic and exciting.
all this mixed with scenes that are a tribute to the first Top Gun."
Alex B,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023",Best blockbuster  movie that I haven't seen in a longtime! Tom Cruise still got it.

Qumars R,0.5,"Dec 28, 2023","Penny got a car, devastated"
Rainbow C,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Great movie from start to finish.
Peter V,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Silly and predictable - hero survives, is lauded and gets the girl. Supporting cast is  weak and action takes are not credible. Escapists - enjoy! :)"
Julia M,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Absolutely amazing and exciting, best movie of the year!"
Christian S,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Wow! A perfect entertaining movie start to finish!

Dennie v,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie. Story is good but missing some feelings. The original had some great music. Whenever i hear 'great balls of fire' or 'take my breath away' i'll think back to the original movie. Maverick misses this feel good moments.

Great movie but could be better 😘"
Luke G,5.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Arguably, the best follow-up to its predecessor."
Scott C,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023",Truly a masterpiece and how sequels should be done
Newton C,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","Fantastic, lots of action and great fun, especially for those who like planes. Incredible images. Wonderful shots. Great film to sit back, relax and have fun. In my opinion, it was better than the first one, which was already very good."
Karthik R,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023","Absolute entertainment!! Goes to show just why movies are made and people flock to the theatres. Amazing direction, Superbly hooky script, dialogues are heart wrenching, and the goose bumps come and stay! Bruckhiemer and Tom Cruise have once again, marvelled in the art of film making to show studios and production houses alike, that this is how it should be done! Respect!!"
Clover G,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible and most definitely the best movie of the year. It is inspiring, extremely heart touching and will have you in an array of emotions throughout its duration. The acting is also very good, with great performances from its lead actors. Must watch!"
Matheus A,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023","In an era of very digital action films, this sequel to the 80s classic is a relief and a gift!"
Tyson S,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023",Good old fashioned action packed cinema. Seldom does as sequel top the original movie but Top Gun Maverick manages this in every aspect! Hands down one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
Jamie S,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023","10/10
Surprisingly, one of the best movies of 2022.

9/10 for me is being happy to pay for it at a movie theatre and I saw it twice, so 10/10.

I own it and still pop it on once in a while because it's a movie that keeps you engaged, light and easy to follow while still giving you great moments."
BB I,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023",Old school movie. One of the most enjoyable for quite sometime.
,4.5,"Dec 22, 2023",Much better than the first film
David,4.5,"Dec 21, 2023","Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this sequel is at the same level as the original. It kept my eyes on the screen and held my attention well like all great movies do. The action sequences are exciting to watch. The fun ended too soon for me."
Dylan  R,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",I thought it was very intense.
adrianne,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",its literally so good!! lots of action
Emilliano Jr S,3.0,"Dec 18, 2023",An overated sequel with a slight improvement from the 80's classic.
Cinebuff H,5.0,"Dec 15, 2023","I was born in 89' so I had no idea of Top Gun the original until early mid 90's when Hip Hop songs would reference it and maybe I'd see it somewhere else in pop culture. I say that to say, I watched Maverick with zero context of the past, just let the movie play out on its own with no preconceived notion for what it had to live up to, and it was awesome. I missed the boat of watching it theaters, life happens. Finally watched it, but at home, with a proper 5.1 surround sound and it delivered with the visuals, sfx, and finally acting of course. Every actor came through for their characters, from the OG Hollywood names to the new ones, it all came full circle in a meta kind of way to see them tell the story of time passing. Visually this film delivered in truly putting you into the action. Tom Cruise really shined and brought out the best around him and vice versa. This is going to be my new Christmas movie simply because there's snow, that counts right? Watch and rewatch it! Do yourself a favor and get a quality surround sound, films like these deserve to be played with quality sub woofers."
Chris D,3.5,"Dec 14, 2023","it is Entertaining, the flight sequences are really good. but some of the realism gets me on some of the scenes. but over all it is a good show."
Kevin M,5.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Loved it. Tom Cruise nailed it again.
Melchizedek Franz Noval S,5.0,"Dec 8, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick is an absolute must-see film of 2022, which is a thrill-ride for an outstanding blockbuster to an incredible journey filled with friendship, passion and loyalty. With a great cinematography, visual effects, and a successful acting career for Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell."
Drew A,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023",Great movie and soundtrack! Classic!
Muhammad Aniq Z,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023","""Top Gun: Maverick"" is totally epic! The flying scenes are insane, and Tom Cruise as Maverick is still super cool. It's like a mix of old-school vibes and crazy new graphics. The whole training scene is intense, and Maverick's character gets even more awesome. They bring in new pilots too, which is pretty cool. The story is kinda easy to anticipate, but who cares when the movie is this much fun? It's like a high-flying tribute to the classic, and you don't wanna miss the ride! Totally would recommend it for a blockbuster movie night with friends!"
St R,5.0,"Dec 6, 2023","I have a running top 10-ish list of movies I love. It's been a LONG time since a new one shot right up high on that list! This film does everything right! It's a US military movie, some will hate that but screw them. No shoehorned social agendas. This is a movie about excellence and service and sacrifice, it's about warriors and what they'll put on the line for each other. And it's about how relationships are what really make us come alive; having someone TO fight FOR is what really matters in the end."
eddiesut13,5.0,"Dec 5, 2023",It's a fun movie to watch. Big visuals and classic songs. A little cheesey at times. Overall what a movie should be. And the third act didn't completely suck like a lot of movies these days.
Schizo V,4.0,"Dec 4, 2023",One of the movies that must be shown in theaters.
,5.0,"Dec 2, 2023","Best combat pilot movie since the original top gun movie. SPOILERS: It finally lays to rest some serious closures from the loss of Goose. I especially love that this pays tribute Val Kilmer. My only fret is the combat mission is very similar to Star Wars A New Hope. Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least. Beg there will be a third movie and wish we had other films with the Top Gun - but this movie fills the soul."
Peter F,2.5,"Dec 1, 2023","Honestly so over movies like this. Actors with way too much makeup on, perfect hair, overly dramatized script, predictable storyline. Bleh. I'd recommend it as a watch just because I'm a cinefile and will watch almost anything once. But I wish Tom Cruise and other Hollywood folks would stop making dumb movies like this."
Benjiboy t,5.0,"Nov 29, 2023",Might be the best movie since Top Gun
Zaya G,5.0,"Nov 27, 2023",Amazing and thrilling moving. Great directing by Joseph Kosinski!
Andy H,5.0,"Nov 22, 2023","Movie of the year ofc, excited to see more!"
Steve D,1.5,"Nov 19, 2023",Fans of the first will find a lot to like but it covers nothing new.
JT H,4.0,"Nov 19, 2023","This movie was pretty solid. I don't think it's as good as most people say, but it's good. The action is amazing, and Tom Cruise is fantastic."
CJ S,1.5,"Nov 18, 2023",Just no. Couldn't get through the first 20 minutes. Boring. Bad acting.
wilson s,5.0,"Nov 17, 2023","It does not matter if you haven't seen the original beforehand, all the information you need is covered very quickly. And while there is a mission and an intriguing plot with twists, the main strength is it's outstanding execution of it's characters. It evaded politics and instead had every character navigate each other's personalities, agendas, and past. The story between Goose's son and Maverick is interesting and by the end, very wholesome. Surprisingly fantastic movie!"
Cullen L,5.0,"Nov 15, 2023",Its a Great movie. One of the best!
Daniel D,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023","like I said at the first movie, bro has beef with the hard deck"
Benjamin E,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",A movie made purely for the purpose of entertainment.  A refreshing change from most movies that being used as a pulpit to lecture audiences about political issues. This one doesn't get political.  People from all walks of life will be entertained and not lectured. No politics in this. It truly is a crowd pleaser
Landon S,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",An absolute cinematic masterpiece
Ray C,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023",Tom Cruises performance was amazing and the roll fits him perfectly. Loved how much everyone is developed and changes throughout the movie. Great cgi
matthias s,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023","Top Gun maverick is an action-packed, high-octane adrenaline rush that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. It's a perfect blend of action, romance, and drama that will have you hooked from start to finish.

Firstly, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. The stunning aerial footage of fighter planes soaring through the sky is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the sound effects will have you feeling like you're right in the middle of the action.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

Top Gun Maverick is a true masterpiece of its genre and a must-watch for any movie lover. It's an epic adventure that will leave you feeling exhilarated and wanting more."
Parker N,5.0,"Nov 8, 2023","I was not alive for then the first one came out so when we saw this second weekend of it coming out, I really loved this movie. It did a good job, without explicitly telling you everything, about what happened in the first, so you don't feel so lost. As someone who never saw the first one, this was a very, very great movie."
Marc Joseph K,5.0,"Nov 6, 2023",Tom Cruise Nailed It!
Chase C,4.5,"Nov 5, 2023","This movie is amazing, and it is WAY better than the original in my opinion. My only issue is that the romance feels pretty forced and it genuinely adds nothing to the movie."
Chris A,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023",Formulaic and predictable and all of that...as well as a total blast. It hit every note just like a great piece of music I want to sing along to. It knew I knew and we still had fun together.
Pablo R,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023","Increíble, una de las mejores películas del 2023 y quizá de la historia, la trama, música, desarrollo de los personajes, todo es increíble, digno de verse en pantalla IMAX o acompañar de un buen sonido en casa"
ngelGaby,5.0,"Nov 1, 2023","Mean... THIS IS CINEMA, tom Cruise Is so god in the role from pete Mitchell, direction Is phenomenal and the action scenes are so amazing"

Daniela P,0.5,"Oct 23, 2023","I've seen this movie countless times in the form of the typical brainwashing Hollywood cliches, but I have to admit that the ending was so dumb, that for a moment I thought that it turns the movie to some kind of a parody of these cliches. The critics' evaluation of 96% is beyond my understanding, I wouldn't give more than 10% to this total waste of time."
CK Movie Reviews,5.0,"Oct 21, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick did everything right. enhances action sequences, better character development, a compelling story and higher stakes."

Jonathan L,5.0,"Oct 20, 2023","I saw this 3 times at the cinema because I simply couldn't get enough. It is edge of your seat exciting. With heavy doses of nostalgia and Star Wars mixed in. Highly recommended, I loved every second. This is what can be accomplished when you care about the original IP and build on it from the position of loving what came before."
Ronald  R,5.0,"Oct 19, 2023",Great Movie!!! Highly Recommended!!! A++ 🍿🎥🍿
,4.5,"Oct 17, 2023","Intense and a blast! I honestly thought this one was better than the first. The first one is a glorified love story and this one was packed full of action. By the time the final fight comes around, it leaves you on the edge of your seat ready to rock and roll!"
Rob A,5.0,"Oct 17, 2023",A spectacular sequel and must see.
monty C,5.0,"Oct 16, 2023","We waited a very long time for this one to come out, but the same cast and love story is genuine."

Sarah A,2.0,"Oct 13, 2023",Another Tom Cruise ego movie. Not impressed with his performance and the story line was predictable. It was nice to see Iceman.
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."
Patryk S,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Perfect movie, one of a few when second movie is better than first one."
Josh,5.0,"Jul 7, 2025",Instant classic. Absolute cinema!

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."
B F.,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025",Tom’s really got this action genre figured out I guess.

James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."

Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far. After seeing how well T2 Judgement Day, Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight did so well, Top Gun Maverick its what hold its cinema an entertainment summer movie. Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"
Jimmy R,2.5,"Dec 31, 2024","It has a 99% score cause of all the fan boys and girls :D Its an okay action movie if you dont expect anything. Its so, SO! predictable. If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D
It passes the time but not a 99% movie at all."
T J,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Pure awesomeness, thank you Tom Cruise"
Nolan S,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Probably best movie I have ever seen, absolute Cinema"
Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."
Chloe  _,4.5,"Dec 23, 2024",I mean wow. Did not think it could be better than the original but the plot and development are just stunning. Really makes you feel something.

Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Wing Hong C,5.0,"Oct 30, 2024","peak visuals, oscar deserved"
Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.
max e,5.0,"Oct 20, 2024",Best movie of 2022 with great action
Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"
Garrett B,5.0,"Oct 15, 2024",There has not yet been a legacy sequel more awesome than this. 🇺🇸 😎✈️🪖

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."
Samjhana K,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024",Phenomenal! Worth the wait.
Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint. 
Perfect mix of nostalgia, American bravado, and pure action-packed fun. Very satisfying and leaves you wanting more."
,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."
Mundo C,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","BEST movie ever, absolutely all were perfect"
Keith N,5.0,"Oct 1, 2024","This is a great movie, it's probably better than the first film in my personal opinion. The first one is still great, don't get me wrong, but I liked this more"
Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

N M,5.0,"Jun 14, 2024",So good. So rewatchable. Thanks Tom Cruise for temporarily saving Hollywood.
Jimmy  D,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",I was not sure how a sequel so many years later would be especially in todays age. But i was pleasantly surprised and it was Great.
Owen G,5.0,"Jun 12, 2024",Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me in every possible way. Top Gun Maverick is an absolute gem.
OSCAR P,0.5,"Jun 12, 2024",I worked with these A/C on the flightline back in the day. This movie portrays NOTHING in reality.
,5.0,"Jun 11, 2024",Best movie I have seen in a long time
Leroy P,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Incredible viewing, you really felt you were in the cockpit feeling what the pilots were going through"
Rebecca D,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024","This is the best movie in the world. I watched this movie before the original Top Gun, but still. Tom Cruise does amazing in his role as Maverick."
Matthew S,4.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Great special effects, Tom was good as the aging top gun educating the new generation. Casting just so so."
Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."
Yuki O,4.5,"Jun 1, 2024",2回見ました。迫力すごい。トムクルーズイケメン。

Felipe F,5.0,"May 28, 2024",Conseguiram passar por cima do Top Gun de 1986 e deixaram a história impecável.
Kiah B,5.0,"May 25, 2024","Stress inducing, but in a good way."
Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."
Fábio e,5.0,"May 4, 2024",Filme excelente. Execução espetacular 10/10
Joel K,4.5,"May 2, 2024",This movie is the best sequel I ever seen.
Carter C.,5.0,"May 1, 2024","With undeniably hyper-thrilling flight scenes and performances more powerful than the original could ever be, Maverick has humor and emotion that’ll somehow make any viewer cry and cheer simultaneously."
Kyle M,3.5,"Apr 27, 2024",Serviceable action movie. Don't get the hype.

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."
CONNIE,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024",this was really good I enjoyed it with the husband

Cheryl D,5.0,"Apr 12, 2024","just wow everything about this film is superb from the flight scenes to tom cruise 
its as good as the original and that's saying something ..i would give this oscar's 
throughly enjoyed it ,will watch it again lots it's delightful exciting and upbeat. no secret message drummed into you about some boring topical news thing … just light entertainment at its best 
my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals. Tom Cruise reprises his role with phenomenal charisma, while newcomer Miles Teller delivers a breakout performance."
Christine C,5.0,"Apr 11, 2024","Might actually be the best movie I've ever watched.   Loved it, even the cheesy parts."
Iroo M,5.0,"Apr 11, 2024","Amazing story filled with excellent action, Top Gun: Maverick is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Great work for all actors, directors, staffs, etc."
,4.5,"Apr 9, 2024","Great sequel - overall good story line, good action - a little over the top but would rather than that underwhelming. Plus they left us hanging for a long time to get this."
David B,2.0,"Apr 1, 2024","Did not like the first top gun,and top gun 2 is just as bad very over the top American bullshit,bar scenes embarrassing to watch,tom cruise is good,but sorry it was same story as before,glad I did not pay to see this"
Mark F,3.5,"Mar 31, 2024",I was surprised by good character development.  It does have a bit of absurd moments at the beginning and end.  Good popcorn flick.
RedStripeZoom,5.0,"Mar 31, 2024","This is a sequel done right, such a memorable time seeing this in the cinema."
Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"
Eran A,5.0,"Mar 26, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
David H,4.5,"Mar 25, 2024","I enjoyed this more than the original film. Great action flick, full of cheese and machismo. Movies like this hardly get made anymore."
A,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","I wasn't expecting this to be good.. I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!
Huw J,2.0,"Mar 23, 2024","Just watched some of thus on TV, Nd turned over after an hour...... it's so boring and cliché ridden."

Enrique,5.0,"Mar 13, 2024",Absolutely Fantastic Movie!
,0.5,"Mar 12, 2024",It's one of the corniest movies ever made. Honestly a waste of time.
Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."
Anton A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","Straight-forward, fun sequel to Top Gun."
Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.
Kristoffer Tofte W,5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Most importanly good action and beautiful scenery, but also some history behind the characters."

Robert R,3.5,"Jan 1, 2024",getting tired of nostalgia pieces. If they were going to make a sequel it should have happened a long time ago.

really enjoyed it turned off my brain and just enjoyed."
B B,4.5,"Dec 30, 2023","The script for the fast & urgent dialogues were insane. Cinematography absolutely spot on. While the happy ending was a nice treat, a more tragic ending would have taken it to 5 stars."
Christopher H,2.0,"Dec 29, 2023","Stupid, one-dimensional drivel, chok full of clichés. TV movie quality acting, at best."
Dani N,4.5,"Dec 29, 2023","Near to be Perfect, The only thing I have been missing is to see the latest generation airplanes. Excellent action scenes, realistic and exciting.
all this mixed with scenes that are a tribute to the first Top Gun."
Alex B,5.0,"Dec 28, 2023",Best blockbuster  movie that I haven't seen in a longtime! Tom Cruise still got it.

Rainbow C,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Great movie from start to finish.
Peter V,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Silly and predictable - hero survives, is lauded and gets the girl. Supporting cast is  weak and action takes are not credible. Escapists - enjoy! :)"

Dennie v,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie. Story is good but missing some feelings. The original had some great music. Whenever i hear 'great balls of fire' or 'take my breath away' i'll think back to the original movie. Maverick misses this feel good moments.

Great movie but could be better 😘"
Luke G,5.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Arguably, the best follow-up to its predecessor."
Scott C,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023",Truly a masterpiece and how sequels should be done
Newton C,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","Fantastic, lots of action and great fun, especially for those who like planes. Incredible images. Wonderful shots. Great film to sit back, relax and have fun. In my opinion, it was better than the first one, which was already very good."
Karthik R,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023","Absolute entertainment!! Goes to show just why movies are made and people flock to the theatres. Amazing direction, Superbly hooky script, dialogues are heart wrenching, and the goose bumps come and stay! Bruckhiemer and Tom Cruise have once again, marvelled in the art of film making to show studios and production houses alike, that this is how it should be done! Respect!!"
Clover G,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible and most definitely the best movie of the year. It is inspiring, extremely heart touching and will have you in an array of emotions throughout its duration. The acting is also very good, with great performances from its lead actors. Must watch!"
Matheus A,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023","In an era of very digital action films, this sequel to the 80s classic is a relief and a gift!"
Tyson S,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023",Good old fashioned action packed cinema. Seldom does as sequel top the original movie but Top Gun Maverick manages this in every aspect! Hands down one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
Jamie S,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023","10/10
Surprisingly, one of the best movies of 2022.

9/10 for me is being happy to pay for it at a movie theatre and I saw it twice, so 10/10.

I own it and still pop it on once in a while because it's a movie that keeps you engaged, light and easy to follow while still giving you great moments."
BB I,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023",Old school movie. One of the most enjoyable for quite sometime.
,4.5,"Dec 22, 2023",Much better than the first film
David,4.5,"Dec 21, 2023","Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this sequel is at the same level as the original. It kept my eyes on the screen and held my attention well like all great movies do. The action sequences are exciting to watch. The fun ended too soon for me."
Dylan  R,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",I thought it was very intense.
adrianne,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",its literally so good!! lots of action
Emilliano Jr S,3.0,"Dec 18, 2023",An overated sequel with a slight improvement from the 80's classic.
Cinebuff H,5.0,"Dec 15, 2023","I was born in 89' so I had no idea of Top Gun the original until early mid 90's when Hip Hop songs would reference it and maybe I'd see it somewhere else in pop culture. I say that to say, I watched Maverick with zero context of the past, just let the movie play out on its own with no preconceived notion for what it had to live up to, and it was awesome. I missed the boat of watching it theaters, life happens. Finally watched it, but at home, with a proper 5.1 surround sound and it delivered with the visuals, sfx, and finally acting of course. Every actor came through for their characters, from the OG Hollywood names to the new ones, it all came full circle in a meta kind of way to see them tell the story of time passing. Visually this film delivered in truly putting you into the action. Tom Cruise really shined and brought out the best around him and vice versa. This is going to be my new Christmas movie simply because there's snow, that counts right? Watch and rewatch it! Do yourself a favor and get a quality surround sound, films like these deserve to be played with quality sub woofers."
Chris D,3.5,"Dec 14, 2023","it is Entertaining, the flight sequences are really good. but some of the realism gets me on some of the scenes. but over all it is a good show."
Kevin M,5.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Loved it. Tom Cruise nailed it again.
Melchizedek Franz Noval S,5.0,"Dec 8, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick is an absolute must-see film of 2022, which is a thrill-ride for an outstanding blockbuster to an incredible journey filled with friendship, passion and loyalty. With a great cinematography, visual effects, and a successful acting career for Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell."
Drew A,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023",Great movie and soundtrack! Classic!
Muhammad Aniq Z,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023","""Top Gun: Maverick"" is totally epic! The flying scenes are insane, and Tom Cruise as Maverick is still super cool. It's like a mix of old-school vibes and crazy new graphics. The whole training scene is intense, and Maverick's character gets even more awesome. They bring in new pilots too, which is pretty cool. The story is kinda easy to anticipate, but who cares when the movie is this much fun? It's like a high-flying tribute to the classic, and you don't wanna miss the ride! Totally would recommend it for a blockbuster movie night with friends!"
St R,5.0,"Dec 6, 2023","I have a running top 10-ish list of movies I love. It's been a LONG time since a new one shot right up high on that list! This film does everything right! It's a US military movie, some will hate that but screw them. No shoehorned social agendas. This is a movie about excellence and service and sacrifice, it's about warriors and what they'll put on the line for each other. And it's about how relationships are what really make us come alive; having someone TO fight FOR is what really matters in the end."
eddiesut13,5.0,"Dec 5, 2023",It's a fun movie to watch. Big visuals and classic songs. A little cheesey at times. Overall what a movie should be. And the third act didn't completely suck like a lot of movies these days.
Schizo V,4.0,"Dec 4, 2023",One of the movies that must be shown in theaters.
,5.0,"Dec 2, 2023","Best combat pilot movie since the original top gun movie. SPOILERS: It finally lays to rest some serious closures from the loss of Goose. I especially love that this pays tribute Val Kilmer. My only fret is the combat mission is very similar to Star Wars A New Hope. Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least. Beg there will be a third movie and wish we had other films with the Top Gun - but this movie fills the soul."
Peter F,2.5,"Dec 1, 2023","Honestly so over movies like this. Actors with way too much makeup on, perfect hair, overly dramatized script, predictable storyline. Bleh. I'd recommend it as a watch just because I'm a cinefile and will watch almost anything once. But I wish Tom Cruise and other Hollywood folks would stop making dumb movies like this."
Benjiboy t,5.0,"Nov 29, 2023",Might be the best movie since Top Gun
Zaya G,5.0,"Nov 27, 2023",Amazing and thrilling moving. Great directing by Joseph Kosinski!
Andy H,5.0,"Nov 22, 2023","Movie of the year ofc, excited to see more!"
Steve D,1.5,"Nov 19, 2023",Fans of the first will find a lot to like but it covers nothing new.
JT H,4.0,"Nov 19, 2023","This movie was pretty solid. I don't think it's as good as most people say, but it's good. The action is amazing, and Tom Cruise is fantastic."
CJ S,1.5,"Nov 18, 2023",Just no. Couldn't get through the first 20 minutes. Boring. Bad acting.
wilson s,5.0,"Nov 17, 2023","It does not matter if you haven't seen the original beforehand, all the information you need is covered very quickly. And while there is a mission and an intriguing plot with twists, the main strength is it's outstanding execution of it's characters. It evaded politics and instead had every character navigate each other's personalities, agendas, and past. The story between Goose's son and Maverick is interesting and by the end, very wholesome. Surprisingly fantastic movie!"
Cullen L,5.0,"Nov 15, 2023",Its a Great movie. One of the best!
Daniel D,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023","like I said at the first movie, bro has beef with the hard deck"
Benjamin E,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",A movie made purely for the purpose of entertainment.  A refreshing change from most movies that being used as a pulpit to lecture audiences about political issues. This one doesn't get political.  People from all walks of life will be entertained and not lectured. No politics in this. It truly is a crowd pleaser
Landon S,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",An absolute cinematic masterpiece
Ray C,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023",Tom Cruises performance was amazing and the roll fits him perfectly. Loved how much everyone is developed and changes throughout the movie. Great cgi
matthias s,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023","Top Gun maverick is an action-packed, high-octane adrenaline rush that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. It's a perfect blend of action, romance, and drama that will have you hooked from start to finish.

Firstly, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. The stunning aerial footage of fighter planes soaring through the sky is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the sound effects will have you feeling like you're right in the middle of the action.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

Top Gun Maverick is a true masterpiece of its genre and a must-watch for any movie lover. It's an epic adventure that will leave you feeling exhilarated and wanting more."
Parker N,5.0,"Nov 8, 2023","I was not alive for then the first one came out so when we saw this second weekend of it coming out, I really loved this movie. It did a good job, without explicitly telling you everything, about what happened in the first, so you don't feel so lost. As someone who never saw the first one, this was a very, very great movie."
Marc Joseph K,5.0,"Nov 6, 2023",Tom Cruise Nailed It!
Chase C,4.5,"Nov 5, 2023","This movie is amazing, and it is WAY better than the original in my opinion. My only issue is that the romance feels pretty forced and it genuinely adds nothing to the movie."
Chris A,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023",Formulaic and predictable and all of that...as well as a total blast. It hit every note just like a great piece of music I want to sing along to. It knew I knew and we still had fun together.
Pablo R,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023","Increíble, una de las mejores películas del 2023 y quizá de la historia, la trama, música, desarrollo de los personajes, todo es increíble, digno de verse en pantalla IMAX o acompañar de un buen sonido en casa"
ngelGaby,5.0,"Nov 1, 2023","Mean... THIS IS CINEMA, tom Cruise Is so god in the role from pete Mitchell, direction Is phenomenal and the action scenes are so amazing"

Mike M,5.0,"Oct 23, 2023",The absolute best movie in years. Entertaining from beginning to end!!! Exciting and well acted. Tom Cruise in top form!!!
Daniela P,0.5,"Oct 23, 2023","I've seen this movie countless times in the form of the typical brainwashing Hollywood cliches, but I have to admit that the ending was so dumb, that for a moment I thought that it turns the movie to some kind of a parody of these cliches. The critics' evaluation of 96% is beyond my understanding, I wouldn't give more than 10% to this total waste of time."
CK Movie Reviews,5.0,"Oct 21, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick did everything right. enhances action sequences, better character development, a compelling story and higher stakes."
William F,5.0,"Oct 20, 2023",Good job in nbhghygygh
Jonathan L,5.0,"Oct 20, 2023","I saw this 3 times at the cinema because I simply couldn't get enough. It is edge of your seat exciting. With heavy doses of nostalgia and Star Wars mixed in. Highly recommended, I loved every second. This is what can be accomplished when you care about the original IP and build on it from the position of loving what came before."
Ronald  R,5.0,"Oct 19, 2023",Great Movie!!! Highly Recommended!!! A++ 🍿🎥🍿
,4.5,"Oct 17, 2023","Intense and a blast! I honestly thought this one was better than the first. The first one is a glorified love story and this one was packed full of action. By the time the final fight comes around, it leaves you on the edge of your seat ready to rock and roll!"
Rob A,5.0,"Oct 17, 2023",A spectacular sequel and must see.
monty C,5.0,"Oct 16, 2023","We waited a very long time for this one to come out, but the same cast and love story is genuine."

Sarah A,2.0,"Oct 13, 2023",Another Tom Cruise ego movie. Not impressed with his performance and the story line was predictable. It was nice to see Iceman.
,4.5,"Oct 12, 2023",Fantastic movie entertaining from start to finish this is why we go to the movies
Ronan D,5.0,"Oct 10, 2023",It's extremely rare for a sequel to surpass its predecessor. Top Gun Maverick soars higher than the first. This proves that Tom Cruise can save Hollywood.
Alisson,5.0,"Oct 10, 2023","o que esse filme entregou n está escrito, slk"
Shipton M,4.0,"Oct 8, 2023","This felt like the film version of parade confetti, but I loved the fun of it."
John w,5.0,"Oct 8, 2023",I watched this Movie 4 times within the 1st 5 weeks of being out. There's your 5 stars..  A must see movie..
K,1.0,"Oct 8, 2023","Total BS plot.  Fake flying   Fake bar, fake military uniforms. Just over it's junk. No way our military would act like there's only one option and make it all depend on one person. Plus Cruise treats our military like garbage and that they should cater to him."
Joo L,5.0,"Oct 8, 2023","Top Gun Maverick era pra ser considerado um elogio de tão bom que ele é, simplesmente incrível o trabalho que nele foi feito, Tom Cruise realmente leva a muito serio a qualidade em seus filmes, um filme emocionante e com cenas de fazer você ficar na ponta da cadeira, 9,8 fácil para está obra."
Vic T,5.0,"Oct 6, 2023",What an outstanding sequel. The kind of sequel the original movie deserved. Congratulations to everyone involved. I guess there are still people who knows what an action movie is about.
AARON M,5.0,"Oct 6, 2023",Better then the first top gun movie
DK,5.0,"Oct 5, 2023","This movie is just made for the ones who has that surge of mental emotions, just waiting to come out. An amazing cast, and a wonderful end to Mav. An ace overall! Salut."
Marcos F,5.0,"Oct 3, 2023",Filmaço. Grande filme
c c,1.5,"Oct 2, 2023","This was clearly made by diversity hires.  The writing and story are awful.  They make some bs mission with bs details.  is this really worth what they're doing?  don't even get me started on the romance part of the movie.  I had to skip before i died of cringe. 

I'm not saying the first one was good but it clearly had some brain cells behind it, where this one was, lacking."
Annis,5.0,"Oct 1, 2023",One of the best movie i have seen. Loved it !!!
Luke M,5.0,"Oct 1, 2023","Tom Cruise reprises his role perfectly in this modern-day throwback to the blockbuster movies that we all loved from the 80's.
The film is a breath of fresh air when compared to the stale movie writing that has churned out of Hollywood throughout the last decade. It hits all of the highs that you'd expect of a Tom Cruise blockbuster and still has time for a well thought out sequel with great storytelling.
Thrilling action, breathtaking effects, enviable character development and plot.
This was definitely the best film of the year by a long way!"
Mark,3.5,"Sep 30, 2023",IT's mostly what I expected ... Too bad it took so long to get here

matthew w,4.0,"Sep 23, 2023","After nearly forty years since the original Tom Cruise's Maverick is back this time to train a group of graduates for a special assignment, it may not sound that exciting but believe me the flight scenes are simply amazing."
Jorge Alberto C,5.0,"Sep 22, 2023","Es increíble, el mejor de todos!"
MariJos 8,3.5,"Sep 22, 2023","""It improves on the old way in every way: the story is smarter and more gripping, the dialogue sharper and funnier. The aerial acrobatics are likely to make you feel dizzy"""
Joe M,5.0,"Jul 21, 2025","The original movie was great, but this sequel stands very well on its own, and those new to pilot Maverick can watch the original movie to understand some of the backstory, but not needed in order to watch this movie.

The pacing is spot on and this is a movie that is VERY rewatchable from start to finish."
Kirill D,5.0,"Jul 20, 2025",Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
David F,2.5,"Jul 16, 2025","I guess I can’t understand why so many people loved this movie.  There was some excellent cinematography, but the plot seemed very predictable, and I felt like I had seen this type of movie so many times before. It certainly had some cool moments, but also had some cringey over the top emotional scenes.  It all just felt pretty basic to me."
Shawn V,4.5,"Jul 14, 2025","All around great aerial combat flick. Somewhat unrealistic, but still great action scenes, in my opinion."
Sharon D,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025",Top Class It surpasses Top Gun by Miles and that takes some doing
Vince S,5.0,"Jul 12, 2025","Prefect second installment to Top Gun. Cruise was great,  action was great.  Great story."
Daryl D,5.0,"Jul 11, 2025",It's time to let go.
Matt T,4.5,"Jul 10, 2025",Actually couldn't stand the first top gun so was very reluctant to watch this one. I thought this one was an amazing roller coaster  adrenaline pumping from start to finish. Fantastic
Craig W.,5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","Should have won the Oscar for best picture strictly because it saved Hollywood by bringing people back to the theaters after Covid.  Also, the movie was excellent in the theaters"
Maximilian L,4.5,"Jul 9, 2025",Absolutely loved it! Worth owning!!
Eric S.,5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A great movie wish they had more like them ! Wish they would build more woman Characters like Phoenix actually focus on a great character and story line instead of I’ve had it harder and respect me moor because I’m a woman !
Michael S.,2.0,"Jul 9, 2025","“Top Gun Maverick” is a very overrated film. Some of the plane scenes were cool, but the whole entire mission didn’t make sense due to several factors. The movie focuses on a daring, low-altitude attack against a heavily defended uranium enrichment plant, which experts and veterans point out would likely be handled with different tactics in reality. This movie is very overlooked,because of the nostalgia people feel from watching the first one. The high action plane scenes were another reason this film was overlooked."
Lore O,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Absolutely horrific that this is so popular. The entire movie is just a rip-off of the Death Star trench run from Star Wars. Other than that it's just a rehash of the original. It's completely pathetic. Tom Cruise doesn't deserve a career. 1 Star solely for Miles Teller and Glen Powell. Feel bad for anyone that has to work with that hack.
Sujan A,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","A movie you can watch over and over again. Nothing can beat the original but with today's modern cameras and film, Mr Cruise has given us a peak of what its like to fly in the cockpit. Bravo and well done! Making Movies Great Again."
Alex B,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","This might be my favorite movie of all time. It hits on every beat you'd want in an infinitely rewatchable movie: action, suspense, humor and heart."
Patryk S,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Perfect movie, one of a few when second movie is better than first one."

Maxwell D,3.0,"Jul 6, 2025","As somebody who hasn't watched the first Top Gun, this made no sense. Still, the execution is great."
Millie R,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025","Tom Cruise is getting even better at his craft. This movie was extremely well written, well acted, beautiful and could serve as a stand alone if you were unable to see Top Gun the original. Some movies are almost too good for us mere humans and this is one of them. I would like to see one more if the Gods allow it."
Christopher Z,0.5,"Jul 6, 2025","I cannot honestly believe this movie was loved by so many. I'm not some contrarian, I absolutely love movies both serious cinema and B movies.
But Top Gun: Maverick was so incredibly stupid. It was literally the first movie redone the exact same way with an even more moronic plot than the original. You need to fly low in order to destroy some facility? That's utter nonsense. And then the behind enemy lines stealing of a jet? What is this an Owen Wilson movie? Seriously this movie was so bad I was laughing at how idiotic it was."
martin p,5.0,"Jul 6, 2025",Could be the best movie ever made.   Not kidding.
Ryan N,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025","This blew me away!  I was worried it wasn't going to be as good as the 1st but it knocked it out of the park.  The story was perfect for the character Maverick!  His past struggles and how he gets thru them in this movie is perfect!  I thought having Gooses son was not going to work but it as well was perfect.  

The real life action of the fighter planes were amazing!!  I absolutely loved this movie.  

I am a huge Tom Cruise fan since the original Top Gun movie.  

Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this movie, and I loved how they brought a past character from the 1st movie (only mentioned by name).  

Miles Teller and Glen Powell were great as well and I am becoming big fans of theirs now."
B F.,5.0,"Jul 5, 2025",Tom’s really got this action genre figured out I guess.

Matt M,5.0,"Jun 21, 2025","TC still got it. Perfect combo of action with a splash of comedy, and romance. Recommend seeing on big screen if possible to really appreciate the sound effects. 10/10"
James N,2.0,"Jun 20, 2025","The flight scenes are incredible, as expected. The movie, as a whole, is garbage. The casting, the story line, the sets..... just bad. It's like ""Bring It On"" meets ""Fast and Furious"". The original Top Gun was filmed on navy bases, in real bars, in real barracks, etc. This is a hodge podge of bad sets, CGI back grounds, and ridiculous hollywood movie tricks. Bummer."

Rushi G,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Another word for 'glorious' is Top Gun: Maverick. Period
,4.5,"May 22, 2025","Maverick is the perfect legacy sequel any iconic film can have. It takes you through nostalgia trip of the original without taking it for granted. It has a better screenplay, more heartfelt emotions, higher stakes and bigger action scenes. Add to that the characters are brilliantly crafted and performed flawlessly."
Rovo S,5.0,"May 21, 2025",This movie is a masterpiece!

Brayden G,5.0,"May 16, 2025",Way better than the first one I saw this in the theaters when it came out so intense in the Theaters it’s so good on the biggest screen possible
Jose N,4.0,"May 16, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is a good movie. It's a great 2nd movie to Top Gun, but its not a good as Top Gun. It feels ""forced"", ""squeezed"" into a very specific layout."
Ethan C,5.0,"May 16, 2025","Over the last few years, I have watched this film way more times than I could count. This is easily becoming a top 7 film for me. The amount of action, situation and character development, and cinematography is unmatched. Maverick does a fantastic job at showing homage to the original but plussing it up to match the same action packed feeling as the Mission Impossible films. The added characters with BOB, Phoenix, Hangman, Rooster, Payback, Fanboy, and more add to the stakes of the mission. One of the few movies that actually had me on the edge of my seat in the theatres. Would love a re-release. Fingers crossed for a third."
Stephen T,5.0,"May 15, 2025","This was without a doubt the most entertaining film I've seen in years, and a refreshing break from the usual drivel that seems to pump out of Hollywood these days.  Every actor nailed their performance, and there was not a wasted moment in the show.  I am so glad this film was made."
Luke H,5.0,"May 14, 2025","A superb piece of cinema. Everything you want from a film which reboots a franchise.

The acting is bang on, the writing too. The soundtrack hits every note you’d want and the cinematography is unbelievably good. 

It’s rare that you can sit and watch a film one day, and then opt to watch it back 48 hours later, but this is the kind of quality film you’re happy to do that with.

A piece of cinema anyone and everyone should watch when they get the chance. Even if you have no knowledge of the first film, it’s a superb watch. I personally believe it to be better than its predecessor, which is some going.

A joyous watch. Unreal."

Thomas C,5.0,"May 12, 2025","Watching this in theaters was a hell of an experience. It’s really good if you didn’t watch Top Gun, and amazing if you did. Perfect sequel with a great story and great acting, great cinematography."
Jon M,5.0,"May 5, 2025","Quite simply it's my favourite film in years.

Why do you ask?

It uses practical effects which show how false and fake green screen is.

We have our hero back, Maverick is haunted by his past and yet he is still the man we knew albeit wrestling with his past decisions and the loss of Goose.

We have nostalgia which is genuine not just for effect

We have a new range of characters who add so much.

We have the late great Val Kilmer. Not just for effect but honoured and putting in an amazing performance.

We have the opening text regarding Topgun changed to men and women and have Phoenix the first female pilot. This blends in seemlessly and I didn't bat an eye lid. Why? Because Phoenix is a believable character who isn't perfect. If this was a Disney film she would have painted the target and dropped the kill shot in seconds and ridiculed and put down a broken Maverick who was now useless for the whole film.

After seeing many other classics ruined by modern directors this film is a rarity in that it improves on the original."
Jason Masters,5.0,"May 2, 2025",wow just wow. only flaw if any I wish meg Ryan would have cameo in it.
George T,4.0,"May 1, 2025",Does not disappoint! Enjoyed the first movie. Good sequel!

Obi-wan K,4.5,"Apr 29, 2025",The jet scenes got better (that's the only thing that matters)
Jared C,1.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Predictable hero's journey drivel. So many cliche's it was hard to keep track of. The admittedly entertaining and dramatic flight scenes are ruined by the fact that the climactic mission through a trench at high speed to hit an impossibly small target is practically a frame by frame rip off of Star Wars Episode iV. There may never have been a film less deserving of the praise it has received.
natalie,5.0,"Apr 26, 2025",Great movie!!! Saw it twice in theaters
Ali L,4.5,"Apr 24, 2025","Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the original Top Gun movie from the 1980s. It follows Navy Pilot Pete Mitchell, also referred to as “Maverick”, who is still flying jets after all these years. Maverick is called back to train a group of the best young pilots for a dangerous mission. One of those pilots includes Rooster, who is the son of Maverick’s old friend Goose, which creates a lot of emotion and tension in the film. Yes, the story is about flying, but it is also about facing past struggles and fixing relationships. 
I think one of the most amazing things about this movie is how real everything feels. The flying scenes especially feel real, and that is because the actors were actually filmed in real jets, and it’s not just special effects or green screens. Being able to feel the speed and all the danger shows you just how intense it is to be a pilot. Knowing this is how the movie was filmed just makes the movie even more exciting from the beginning. 
The camerawork throughout the film is extremely smooth, even during the flight scenes. This definitely makes it easy to follow, especially when the movie starts picking up speed. The editing in this film, most importantly, how the shots are all put together, is phenomenal. There’s never a point when you feel something is just dragging on and on,  everything is always moving at a perfect pace. Another great strength of this movie is the sound. The music, the sounds of the jet engines roaring, and the quiet still moments right before everything takes off, all pull you deeper into each scene of the film. 
The director, Joseph Kosinski, did an amazing job incorporating both action aspects and deeper emotional moments. This movie actually has heart behind all the action-packed moments, which makes it even better. Maverick has spent years holding onto guilt, and watching him build a relationship with Rooster, who holds a grudge, makes the story even stronger.  
Both the acting and the characters picked for the film were great. Tom Cruise is a great actor for Maverick. While he still holds his confident and rule breaking attitude, you can definitely tell in the movie that he has matured. He’s not trying to prove to everyone he’s the best anymore. He’s trying to help others. The actor who plays Rooster, Miles Teller, also adds to the heart of the film. You can tell he’s hurt, but you can also tell he wants the opportunity to prove himself. The beginning their relationship starts off a little rocky, but as time goes on, you can see the understanding grow between the two of them. To me, watching their relationship unfold was emotional and by far my favorite part of the movie. 
I will say, Maverick’s love interest, Penny, played by Jennifer Connelly, did a good job, but their relationship didn’t seem to play a big part in the movie. The parts focused on the two seemed more rushed and not entirely meaningful to add to the storyline. It gave the feeling that they made the character just to give him a love interest. 
I liked this movie a lot, maybe even more than the original. I do, however, feel like the movie could have been made even better. When you watch the film, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen for the most part, there’s not much that catches you off guard. 
If you haven’t seen the first Top Gun, that is definitely something you should do before watching the sequel. It will give you a better understanding of the relationships and why certain people and parts of the movie mean so much. The movie does give some things away, but without watching the first one, you won’t have the backstory to understand why certain things mean so much.  
The marketing for this movie was done extremely well.  The trailers for the film showed flying scenes and also showed that a lot of Tom’s stunts were done by himself. Once I saw on social media that the actors were being trained in real jets, that completely grabbed my attention. I thought it was impressive to see the real training the actors went through in order to get a real effect in the film. I knew I was going to see this movie before it was even in theaters. 
Top Gun: Maverick truly surprised me. I pictured it to be similar to the first one, but it turned out to have a lot more meaning than I was expecting. Even though some parts of the movie were pretty clear about what was going to happen, and the love story kind of seemed out of place, it was still an excellent movie to watch. Even if you aren’t a strong military or plane-loving enthusiast, it is a very detailed movie. For an overall rating, I would truthfully give this film a 9 out of 10 rating. It was a highly recommended movie to me, and I 100% recommend it to others."
Brayden M,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","While I didn't enjoy the original Top Gun, this movie kept my interest and is a great example on how to write a sequel."
Sergio S,5.0,"Apr 23, 2025","Excellent script, felt as exciting as the 1986 classic, superb performance by Tom Cruise. A thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish."
Patricia P,5.0,"Apr 20, 2025",Probably the best sequel ever made or a close second. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you were able to see it in theater you're blessed. Truly made for the big screen. Such a fantastic movie.
Cameron R,5.0,"Apr 17, 2025","It's been almost 3 years and I can't count how many times I've watched this masterpiece. I loved the original, and expectations for sequels are always extremely low, but they absolutely nailed it. Probably my ALL-TIME favorite movie... definitely top 3."
Twystd L,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","This was definitely a movie that pulled at the heart strings of anyone that watched the original Top Gun with all the references between Goose and Rooster, as well as, the likeness shared between the actors for Goose and Rooster. Casting was spot on and the a subtle and modern story for the older crowd to enjoy alongside the mainstory of the movie with all the action sequences."
Russell H,4.0,"Apr 14, 2025",The action and characters were great.  Awesome
Dustan B,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Actually waited to watch this movie for about 5 months after it came out. Worried about how a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made would be. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it. from the secon the introduction comes on the screen and Kenny loggins danger zone comes on. It instantly to me. Was known that this was going to be a sequel. That was worth the time
John  R,5.0,"Apr 11, 2025",Lives up to the OG. It's actually way better.
Matthew T,5.0,"Apr 10, 2025",Movies like this are what give USA the reputation at the maker of the best films in the world.
Lindsey S,5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","Love this!!!! love the jets, love the action, and just love Top Gun in general. especially Ice's return and emotional scene with Maverick."
Matthew D,5.0,"Apr 6, 2025","Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.

Director Joseph Kosinski’s war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott’s Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I’d like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick’s moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.

Kosinski’s direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.

Eddie Hamilton’s editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that’s easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There’s nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick’s conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.

Tom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He’s engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He’s an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer’s bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.

Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise’s Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She’s a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick’s new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny’s protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother’s heart ever again. I like to think she’s really his daughter from back then, even though that’s not in the script.

Miles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose’s son.

Jon Hamm’s stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots’ lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.

Ed Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Jay Ellis’ Payback, Danny Ramirez’ Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis’ Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer’s score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga’s wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.

In all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise’s magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski’s fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness."

There was no better cinematic experience in 2022 than Top Gun Maverick. Few people expected the sequel to the original, but everyone who saw it was delighted with its quality.

『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、映画史に残る傑作として称賛されるべき作品です。トム・クルーズが再びピート・""マーヴェリック""・ミッチェル役を演じ、その圧倒的な存在感と演技力で観客を魅了します。

また、ストーリーは前作のファンにとっても新規の観客にとっても満足のいく内容となっています。マーヴェリックの成長と葛藤、そして新たな世代との絆が描かれ、感動的な瞬間が随所に散りばめられています。特に、若手パイロットたちとの関係性は、師弟愛や友情の深さを感じさせ、心温まるシーンが多くあります。

音楽もまた、この映画の魅力の一つです。ハンス・ジマーによる壮大なスコアは、物語の緊張感と感動を一層引き立て、観客の心に深く響きます。

総じて、『トップガン マーヴェリック』は、アクション映画の枠を超えた感動作であり、映画ファンならずとも必見の一作です。トム・クルーズの不屈の精神と、映画制作陣の情熱が結実したこの作品は、間違いなく映画史に名を刻むことでしょう。

Annette D,4.0,"Jan 12, 2025","Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that you might question why it exists, but after watching it, you'll be thankful you did. This sequel was anything but lethargic. Everything was intentional. They did a fabtastic job of alluding and connecting to its predecessor, bringing nostalgia to those who loved the original, while bringing new likeable characters and adding freshness to the story. A great balance.  It has sentimental moments and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I say this coming from someone who saw the sequel before the original and my friend thankfully explained the connections throughout. XP Worth a watch. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch in the future. 9/10"
Eiren W,1.5,"Jan 10, 2025","A film that shows happens when you chuck money at a film, without talent or reason. Fine if you’re bored mid week, but does not earn the rating it has at all. So many more captivating and brilliant films out there that have scores less than this. 
Basically Tom Cruise staring off into the distance and tensing his jawline on loop"

Top Gun Maverick its one of the Top Sequels has made so far.

Top Gun Maverick has some amazing scale of fighters in aerial sequence I have never seen before and the performances its amazing totally Oscar nomiee. This film deserves a summer movie for sure and hopefully turn into a franchise"

If you think it cant check all the clishees - trust me it will. F.e.: Very first scene: ""you go 10 Mach, not 10.2, not 10.1"" and of course he will go over the mark.
And very american patriotic. Doesn´t matter who dies as long as its no person from the US :D

Nolan S,5.0,"Dec 31, 2024","Probably best movie I have ever seen, absolute Cinema"
Iain D,0.5,"Dec 27, 2024","Genuinely awful compared to the original. I don't know why people liked it so much. It was the disappointment of a lifetime. 
The original had a great storyline, it was believable, the characters were believable, the action scenes weren't overly falsified apart from the inverted scene with a MiG/F-5.
Nothing about this film is believable. CGI-tastic. Apparently the creme de la creme of the US Navy aviators are just out of nappies. Maverick flies a Mach 9-doesn't exist-looks ridiculous-nicked it without authorisation plane and ejects landing in a pub.... WTAF?!
The storyline is woeful and the acting is dreadful. 
As a huge fan of the original this is honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Sorry."
Jordan R,5.0,"Dec 26, 2024","One of the best movies ever made if you ask me! I’m an 80’s baby so I eat this up but no matter how old you are this is one of the best movies out there! Hence the 99 score on rotten tomatoes , which is one of the highest scores I have ever seen.  Well deserved Mav, well deserved! ❤️"
Charvine A,4.0,"Dec 26, 2024","A fun and solid movie for sure. I think the rating is a little high because people credit it as ""the movie that saved movies"", by getting people into theatres again after the Covid-19 pandemic. Not all that emotion can be attributed to the movie though. Definitely watch it, but keep your expectations in check."
Chloe  _,4.5,"Dec 23, 2024",I mean wow. Did not think it could be better than the original but the plot and development are just stunning. Really makes you feel something.

Miles  O,2.0,"Dec 13, 2024","I mean it was alright, I found it quite cheesy with most characters having little depth or actual personality about them. I feel like it was mostly about ticking boxes rather than trying to make a good movie."
Deca F,4.5,"Dec 11, 2024","A real actual Summer Blockbuster , much like the original Top Gun but enough fresh and interesting moments and plot to make you go for a rewatch! No forced agendas, just good fun if not a bit slow in some parts."
Pedro Henrique C,5.0,"Dec 7, 2024","Top Gun: Waverick It has an incredible soundtrack, I really liked the opening song of the film, the same as Top Gun 86. Simply Cinema."
Garren P,5.0,"Dec 2, 2024","So, I'm a f-18 and f-14 lover and I have been watching Tom Cruise's movies forever (Mission Impossible, and 1986 Top Gun), But when I first watched this movie I was blown away. I actually went to the movies again to watch it. This is 100% my favorite movie. 😁👍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Jay W,4.0,"Dec 2, 2024","Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.

I remember liking the original ""Top Gun"" (1986). It wasn't high art, but it was good cheesy pizza. Going back to watch that film again recently, sadly it has aged about as well a cheese pizza that has sat out for over 30 years. The film has lost that loving feeling, I hate it when that happens.

Top Gun: Maverick brought back that loving feeling. It is undoubtably BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The film is well paced, focused and full of good character decisions.

The film does not reinvent the wheel by any means, it follows a tried and true formula, but it does all these classic hits very well. The new characters also aren't as interesting as Tom Cruise. They aren't awful, just underdeveloped.

But the show stealer of the whole thing is the aerial action. The dog fights and flying sequences are second to none. They use real planes and real G's, and it feels real. It is filmed with clarity; it communicates to the audience exactly what is going on and why characters are doing it.

Filmed with skill, what a thrill. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!"
Gustav G,5.0,"Dec 1, 2024","I would not have thought that you could make films like this nowadays, but, oh boy, did Tom Cruise prove me wrong! Highlight: the reunion between Ice and Mav! If you liked the first film, fire up your speakers and have fun!"

Julian P,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024","To make a sequel that is better than the original is quite a feat but they managed it. Absolutely astounding - yes of course it's predictable, get over it!"
Rhyan G,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",Perhaps the only reboot/ sequel that is legitimately better than the original. Entertaining plot and plenty of comedic references to its predecessor
Emyr,5.0,"Oct 21, 2024",We all love the beach scene
Paul M,1.0,"Oct 20, 2024","I don't get the love for this one. Silly and cringe-worthy story (even after a 2nd viewing). Too sentimental, made worse by Zimmer's soulless score that keeps droning on. The story arc is a heck of a lot flatter than the bombing mission being flown, lackluster acting, obvious vfx scenes that don't match the real plane action, etc etc.

An unworthy successor to the great 80s Top Gun."
Gregory T,0.5,"Oct 20, 2024",Absolutely terrible movie. I walked out after 10 minutes. Last time I did that was with Mama Mia.

Phillip M,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","Went to the cinema in 1986 to watch the first one and bought the soundtrack, so the franchise holds a cherished place in my memory. Watched the first one again before watching Maverick and thought it doesn't translate too well now to a modern audience. Therefore I was fearful about a second treatment. All fears were unwarranted,  IT IS EXCELLENT! Brilliantly shot, great storyline and wonderful development of Maverick's character. Kept me captivated throughout."
R D,0.5,"Oct 19, 2024","What a roller coaster of a ride!! And just like a roller coaster its good for about 2 minutes, then your off to find something else to do.  How this made the top 10 of the top 300 of all time is way beyond belief.  Im guessing dollars push it there.  Money not well spent."
Aidan,5.0,"Oct 19, 2024","“Top Gun: Maverick” improves upon the original in every single regard. The cast is even more star-studded, the aerial action sequences are bigger and better, and the story is more focused and emotionally resonant. This should be the standard for how to do a legacy sequel right."
Shay W,5.0,"Oct 17, 2024","I remember Tom Cruise appeared at, I think it was a Comic Con, and he described the movie as an ode to flying. It certainly is. Just shot so beautifully. The first 10 minutes, the aircraft carrier with the sun behind it, Maverick on his motorbike, Maverick trying to reach Mach 10. So many wonderful images"

Senne C,3.0,"Oct 10, 2024","For such a masculine movie, this one has no balls whatsoever. Better when you forcibly read queer subtext in it. But ultimately it's the most basic of action movies.

Looks great, though."

Scott  G,5.0,"Oct 7, 2024","Been waiting since 1987 for a sequel to Top Gun and this movie did not disappoint.

,5.0,"Oct 2, 2024","Wow.... What a movie.This is hands down the best movie of 2022, possibly even of this decade. This is one of four movies I have watched more than five times. When I first saw it in the cinema for the first time, I loved it so much, I just had to go and see it a second time on the big screens. Everything is perfect. The acting is amazing, with so much chemistry between the actors. The emotions are there and most times you forget that they are just actors. The amount of time and effort put into this movie in front and behind the cameras is insane, especially with the F-18 training. For the first time ever, there are IMAX cameras in an actual F-18 cockpit, which gives a stellar image. The OST/Soundtrack is the best I've ever heard, with every song/music piece being beautiful and impactful to the scene. Sometimes I listen to soundtrack playlist instead of normal songs you would hear on the radio. The writing, acting, directing, screenplay, Soundtrack are all no joke 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it tonight. It really lives up to the hype. There is so much love and talent put into this movie and could most certainly be this decade's best movie. It is o good, that I'm going to watch it right now after posting this review. This movie is and will forever be in my Top 5, and truly deserves more than a 10/10."

Isaac M,5.0,"Sep 28, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time, no joke. It has action, comedy, it is one of the manliest movies you will ever see, but also has heart and great chemistry within the cast that includes non stop adrenaline rush with its high flying jet scenes"
julie b,3.5,"Sep 23, 2024",Technically very good but this was far too much of “the Tom cruise show” for me to love it
Georgan G,3.5,"Sep 22, 2024","As trite as this sequel is, if you like the original you wil love this.  I'm not a fan, but there is no denying the rush of watching the ""dog fight"" scenes."
Jack F,5.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Hooked from the start. Great action, great plot, great music. Hearing the original track mixed with a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer was phenomenal. Have rewatched it several times already."
Sam P,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","A total snooze fest. Annoying, unlikeable characters retread the tedious footsteps of the annoying, unlikeable but at least vaguely iconic characters of the first movie. Visually dull, politically revolting and structured like a bowl of milkless porridge.

The high scores are because people saw a man on the screen whooping with delight, and like the apes they are they felt compelled to do the same."
Tim L,5.0,"Sep 18, 2024",Probably one of the all time best movies ever made. This is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
Jace E,5.0,"Sep 17, 2024","From the opening title with the familiar theme, it was evident that Top Gun: Maverick was going to pay tribute to its predecessor. With just enough callbacks to feel nostalgic without being overbearing, this film accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Tom Cruise fell back into his role as Maverick with ease, and the introduction of new characters, like Miles Teller’s Rooster, was seamless. There was depth to the characters and real emotion as the aviators find balance between their heroic career and life outside the cockpit. 

The pacing was brilliant with just the right amount of action in the sky and drama on the ground. The plot was simple and clear, though also intricate and awe-inspiring. The theater was full of cheers and gasps as the filmmakers pushed the envelope and showcased a new generation of Top Gun.  

Tom Cruise is one of the most intense performers in Hollywood. While his demeanor might be a little exaggerated at times, it fit the role and situation presented in this film. There were moments that seemed inevitable and obvious, but the movie was so exciting, those flaws were easy to overlook. 

That’s it. I honestly have no more feedback about this phenomenal film! 

Top Gun: Maverick is hands down the best film of the year. It has everything wanted in a summer blockbuster: thrilling action, high stakes, and gripping relationship arcs. Every scene in the air was filmed with precision and every moment on the ground had true emotion. The film as a whole felt complete. Though sequels at times feel bloated and unnecessary, Top Gun: Maverick built upon its forerunner and created a story that goes toe to toe with the original."

Sebastian L,3.5,"Sep 9, 2024","This movie has no business being this good, and a lot of it is due to a great deal of respect for real characters and practical effects. The ending is pushing it a bit when it comes to believability and the dialogue isn't always poetry, but this is certainly a sequel/reboot gone airborne."
בני נ,3.5,"Sep 8, 2024","Top Gun: Maverick delivers good action moments, but something about Cruise's energy and his chemistry with Connelly feels tired and dull."
Liam H,4.5,"Sep 7, 2024","This is such a good movie. It was pretty entertaining from start to finish and the final fight scene was just perfect. Coming from someone who's never seen the first Top Gun movie, everything was still super enjoyable from the get-go. I can't really name anything bad about this movie either. The final fight is easily the best past, it was so intense and definitely had a great payoff in the end. Overall, great movie, I cannot express that enough.

ストーリーはまあ特筆するもんはないかもだが、トムクルーズはやはりスター性がある感じ。グースとの過去のショッキングな出来事、グースJr.との確執を清算するのが軸になっている。クライマックスはもうひと展開あって、映画ってやっぱ予想とは違う展開になることが多いなと再確認した。飛行シーンもリアルに出演人物が乗っているようで、見応えがあった。"

Daniel P,3.0,"Aug 18, 2024","Massively overrated. Tom Cruise acts well enough but just exactly the same as in any other movie. The movie is too long and while the plot makes sense, it's very boring at the beginning. The love story is extremely forced and could be left out in its entirety. That said, they did their best with what they had. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack is top tier - the song by Lady Gaga and One Republic are one of their career highlights."

Irene M,3.5,"Jul 13, 2024","decided to see it only after I enjoyed other movies with Glen Powell and Lewis Pullman. By the climax I have to admit I was riveted by the action. Enjoyed all the extras, learning how all the actors had to go thru a crash course in becoming naval aviators in 6 months so they could film everything without special effects, as well as the documentary on the Skunkworks jet. But felt NO Chemistry between Jennifer Connoly and TOm Cruise, their best scene was the one on the sailboat."

David D,3.5,"Jul 11, 2024","I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, I mean I do to a certain extent, though I do feel it's overblown a wee bit.  It's a solid film, and a worthy successor to the original Top Gun.  It's no masterpiece though.  What it does do is give the audience what they want.  This is a movie that would have been slightly above average in the 80s or 90s, but due to the lack of talent in today's writers(at least those whose scripts are green lit), this shines all the brighter.  To paraphrase an Eddie Murphy joke ""When you are starving, and someone throws you a cracker, you think it's the best damn cracker you've ever eaten.""  So it is with Top Gun: Maverick.  It's an action movie throw back to the 80s, and it hits every mark it needs to for it's genre.  A worthwhile movie to watch, like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time."

Rebecca D,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024","This is the best movie in the world. I watched this movie before the original Top Gun, but still. Tom Cruise does amazing in his role as Maverick."
Matthew S,4.0,"Jun 10, 2024","Great special effects, Tom was good as the aging top gun educating the new generation. Casting just so so."
Frank F,5.0,"Jun 10, 2024",Fantastic movie and great way to followup the original. Excitement all the way and a proper continuation of the story rather than all of the terrible reboots we get these days.
Denis B,5.0,"Jun 9, 2024",Must see perfect balance of planes and glorious acting.
David C,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","A near perfect film. This film is not only better than the original film, it makes the first film better. So often sequels destroy the progression of the protagonist to give them new challenges, this film adeptly avoided this pitfall. Top Gun: Maverick is the benchmark of what a sequel ought to be. Special Effects, are top notch. The Tomcat, the SU-57 and the CG F-18s looked real and blended seamlessly with the practical aircraft used in the filming.  The Darkstar was absolutely believable. That being said the story is top notch. We really feel these characters are believable. And the use of the Hero's Journey make the film hit home with authority. Hollywood take note: we don't want more sequels, we want more GOOD sequels. Second to none, great film. The archetype of what a sequel ought to be!"
Stan K,5.0,"Jun 8, 2024","I confess to thinking this was going to be a horrible film when previews were first shown. I thought someone in Hollywood was pandering to GenX and phoning it in to get some quick bucks off us. I could not have been more wrong.

The action sequences exceeded the original, the pacing was excellent, the story was good.

Like Tom Cruise or hate him, he truly exposed us to many facets of his character which the younger version didn't face. It is easy to see how his character became (or stayed) who he was at this point, and to even acknowledge a very subtle showing of the PTSD the traumatic event in the first film left on him.

Absolutely worth watching and re watching."
Alexis  G,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Great plot, great acting!  The whole family will watch this over and over it was that great."
,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",I had never seen Top Gun and my plan was just to wait until it hits Parmount+. But I heard so much hype for this movie that I decided I couldn’t wait. So on after watching the original I went and saw the sequel. I couldn’t believe how great it was. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. They did and amazing job with the story. The plot was great and the characters were really well thought out. 10/10 would recommend.
Mislav K,5.0,"Jun 7, 2024",Straight forward action movie like they once were. Love it!
Crom M,2.0,"Jun 7, 2024","Did ai write this movie? 
I loved the original, but this movie is awful."
A S,3.0,"Jun 6, 2024","It's a summer popcorn film, for sure. 

However, there is just so much Sci-Fi added to it that didn't need to be there... and some of the acting interactions with the supporting cast are quite contrived feeling.


It just didn't leave me with that Lovin' Feelin' that the first Top Gun did."
Larry K,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024",I know everybody loved this but I was late to the party. This movie was unbelievably awesome. No other words.
D S,5.0,"Jun 3, 2024","Best action movie of the pandemic. Like actors have claimed, this movie literally saved movie theaters. If you did not see this movie in the theaters then I feel sorry for you. This movie was absolutely epic in IMAX. In 10 years they will show this movie in theaters again, unless they come out with another sequel. But Tom Cruise will be too old by then so probably not."

Brian H,5.0,"May 24, 2024",Fantastic movie. I absolutely love it. Probably will rewatch it 20 times throughout my life.
eraklis e,5.0,"May 22, 2024","One of not the best second movie to a classic done, it’s so good it’s hard to choose what to put on between the original and this as it gives all the same feels. Total masterpiece"
Test T,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I watched this on Blu Ray recently.  Just like the original 1986 Top Gun movie this film has some really impressive flight scenes and benefits hugely from Tom Cruise' charisma, but it also has filler scenes that only serve to lower the film's production costs and dumb down the experience during the first half.  Top Gun should be all about the flight school, the training filights and the mission - i.e. the really cool exciting stuff.  Every time I watch one of these movies I end up feeling frustrated by the filler.  The musical score is also a mixed offering this time around.  The music carried over from the original film was great, but I was not impressed by the two new songs featured as music videos on the disc.  The movie improves radically in the 1/3rd act where the action is intense and exhilerating to watch.  Over all, I think this movie is a big improvement on the original, because it has an better story with more action and less filler.  Highly recommended."
Idan Charles L,4.5,"May 22, 2024","I haven't seen the first one, but this was really good"
,5.0,"May 20, 2024",Better than the original in every way. Breathtaking cinematography and great character development paired with suspenseful action sequences make this one of the most re-watchable movies I think i've ever seen.
Olly J,5.0,"May 19, 2024","YES! Just YES!! It's one of the best films ever. Everything a film should be. You can just watch it again and again. It was worth the wait, and it's a Tom Cruise classic. The man is the legend."
Peter S,5.0,"May 19, 2024","What can I say? It's Tom Cruise and yep he did it again. It's cheesy, it's testosterone on steroids, it's action packed, good old fashioned movie magic! Enjoy!"
Polariss S,5.0,"May 19, 2024",Absolutely love Tom Cruise. Never in my life thought I would say this but it just might be better than the og for me.
valentin o,5.0,"May 14, 2024","I loved.
The whole movie is incredible, Tom Cruise was incredible and all good actors and the planes.
very happy and very exciting.
Top Gun's music is very good, very sad and very exciting."
Vitoria F,3.0,"May 14, 2024","All the plane scenes are simply stunning! I would give them six stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't measure up. 100% cliché story, already told in countless movies and which takes up a lot of this film's time."
James F,4.5,"May 13, 2024",Great film. Tom's put on the wings and can now fly like he runs. For me the aerial combat scenes was what this movie was all about. The intense gliding.
Patrick F,4.5,"May 13, 2024","This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!"
Andi K,5.0,"May 10, 2024",This is my favourite movie. There's even some this movie based missions in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
Jon R,0.5,"May 6, 2024",Parachuting out of jet going Mach 100 and then knocking on someone’s door?  This movie is the worst. If I could have given less than a half star I would have.
Bradley H,5.0,"May 5, 2024",Best movie in a really long time. Almost perfect!
Scott M,5.0,"May 5, 2024","To seamlessly pick up Top Gun's plot 30+ years later takes amazing craft.  Appearance, pace, visuals and music very consistent with the flagship film.  Action scenes purposeful and exciting; TGM delivers in all aspects, a real masterpiece, if there is such a thing for a popcorn/bubblegum big budget blockbuster."

Eduardo H,5.0,"Apr 24, 2024","Así es como las películas deberían de ser de nuevo, una historia que si bien toma algunos elementos de nostalgia, bien podría ser un ""Stand Alone"" y aún así es una excelente experiencia cinematográfica. el trabajo y la dedicación que se le puso a esta película transpira a la pantalla grande."

my daughter-in-law has never seen the first one ..and didn't want to watch it .. i was ill and she watched it with me to keep me company and she loved it thought it was an excellent movie"
Dhanu K,4.5,"Apr 12, 2024","The long awaited sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, surpasses its predecessor with marvelous production values, adrenaline-pumping action sequences and stunning visuals.

Mark F,3.5,"Mar 31, 2024",I was surprised by good character development.  It does have a bit of absurd moments at the beginning and end.  Good popcorn flick.
RedStripeZoom,5.0,"Mar 31, 2024","This is a sequel done right, such a memorable time seeing this in the cinema."
Ian W,3.0,"Mar 30, 2024","One purely for the cast in stone top gun and Tom Cruise  fans. It's a dull, mawkish, slow,  chessy,  chick flick with a script confused by premise, with dialogue and exposition written on the nose and riddled with clichés and a romantic story line with as much passion as dead sheep, Cruise isn't Richard Gere and this isn't anywhere near as good as Officer and a Gentleman, Dam Busters and many many more films of this genre."
Bas L,1.5,"Mar 29, 2024",basically advertising for military
Benyamin M,5.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Another Tom Cruise movie which makes me regret I couldn't see it in cinemas. But in Tom Cruise Might be the best of the franchise. Dead Reckoning is very fun and the action is some of the best I've ever seen. And the stunts are insane.we trust. This is in one of the best movies of the 2020s. With great cinematography, action, story, emotion and sound. We can now trust Joseph Konsinski with any movie. And this makes me so hyped for the F1 movie."
billybob 1,4.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Seems outdated, like it missed all the times its tropes have been done before, but the visuals pick up most of the slack.  Watch it on a big screen, in theaters if you can!"
Eran A,5.0,"Mar 26, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
David H,4.5,"Mar 25, 2024","I enjoyed this more than the original film. Great action flick, full of cheese and machismo. Movies like this hardly get made anymore."
A,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","I wasn't expecting this to be good.. I remember the original so well.. fell in love with Tom Cruise back in the day.. so with that in mind I have to say I absolutely loved this film.. there was a decent amount of hat tips to the first film.. some of the same songs used as well to give it the nostalgia vibes.. it was nail biting and tense.. loved it.. thanks Tom, legend."
Christian T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Literally the best sequel ever made, 36yrs after top gun took the world by storm (yes I was there watching it) top gun maverick comes out, I heard the rumours and thought it would just be a cash cow until Tom cruise commited and then you know a film is going to be the real deal, the guy entertains and truly this is his masterpiece"
,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","HOLY SMOKES!!! Everything everyone said about this movie was true. Thrilling, electrifying, funny, action packed, YOU NAME IT! From start to finish I loved this movie and it makes me wonder what it was like to watch the first one in theaters. Tom Cruise does his thing and Miles Teller played “Rooster” perfectly! Good to see Teller back on the big screen, feels like it’s been a minute. Soundtrack was on point (I ain’t worried, OneRepublic is a HIT HIT) and so was the filming. I just can’t say how great this movie was to watch."
Zso V,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. The photography, action and acting all spot on! The plot perfectly balanced not much about the backstory and the ""target"" really secondary. It's more about life story with so well integrated and brilliantly executed action. Highly recommended"
Ira T,5.0,"Mar 24, 2024","A long wait but perfectly done by Tom Cruise. I cried and cried with joy and happiness. I watch it over and over again. Loved how the young pilots picked were non famous at the time, you ate now famous and Thank ""Tom Cruise"", he put on the map. Awesome movie!"
Dexter D,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",Unbelievable film watched it a least 5 times and will watch it so many more. It has everything you want in a fast paced action film. If I could give it any more stars I would. It definitely an unmissable film & up there as one of the best sequels ever.
David F,5.0,"Mar 23, 2024",One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  Rare that a follow up trumps the original but here we have it!! Let's hope there's a part 3!!!

Kahauanu K,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Action action action!  This movie has it!  Taking you into the cockpit with the pilots and making you feel the G's on your own body, the cinematography is fun.  The pacing of the movie takes you from scene to scene without skipping a beat, although the dogfighting scenes may make your heart stop for a bit for a breather.  And for the guys who like movies like Shawshank and Glory, there's a bit of emotion sprinkled in there for you.  I loved every part of the movie."
FEEL THE N,5.0,"Mar 11, 2024","Probably the best move, since 1986"
John R,0.5,"Mar 11, 2024",This was the most ridiculous and over rated movie of all time. The entire plot line is pathetic and Miles Teller finished off the movie with his terrible acting.
Terry H,5.0,"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched it for the third time since its release. Absolutely Awesome! Just give us a movie that entertains, that's all we want.  This one delivers on so many levels.  Loved It!  Great visuals, great sound, good inspiring plot. Really fun watch."
Meishania Queen S,5.0,"Mar 7, 2024","Did you know that all of the actions in the Top Gun Maverick movie are real and don't use computer generated visuals?
So, Hello everyone, for today's review, I wanted to talk about the Tom Cruise film Top Gun: Maverick, which he both directed and performed in. My goal in writing this was to inform you all about Tom Cruise's wonderful film, which is free of any technological graphics, and to get you to watch it. 
As always, Tom Cruise gives his all in every role that comes his way as the lead in whatever film that is provided to him. It's incredible that at the age of 59, he still has the appearance of someone much younger than 45. His intelligent demeanor combined with his grounded mindset is a winning combination. Just so you know, this does not include any spoilers review.
 
Therefore, why is Top Gun: Maverick practically a must-see film? First of all, it's actually better than Top Gun, 1986's predecessor. In essence, this meant that the 1986 top gun's predecessor was the greatest. First of all, the performances by the actors in this movie are incredible. Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is equally impressive; he captures the essence of the conceited pilot who hasn't moved on from the death of his father. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, gives an incredible performance as Maverick; he truly feels like the character he played all those years ago. Also, the remaining members of the cast perform admirably! Secondly, the story itself is amazing! The narrative is amazing and filled with a lot of emotional moments in it. And lastly, the action scenes are amazing! Observing the action scenes was incredibly enjoyable, since they possessed a great deal of tension and were all executed practically! his is amazing because in a world full of CGI now, it's nice for a movie to have things that are done practically now.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and even though I was upset that I had to wait 39 years to see it, it was still worth it. It's an excellent film overall with fantastic action sequences and a compelling narrative. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it! Thus, why do you delay? Before it leaves theaters, make sure to see this film! You won't regret it, I assure you!"
Emerson C,5.0,"Mar 5, 2024",Muito legal este filme! Tom Cruise é sinônimo de sucesso!!!
Morgana G,5.0,"Mar 1, 2024",It has that cliche where USA saves us all but this is certainly a masterpiece.
Yasmin Q,4.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Just as good, if not better, than the original - which isn't a common achievement."
Angus S,4.0,"Feb 26, 2024","High flying fun.  A great way to spend two action-packed hours of adrenaline rush.  You know it had to be good with some snarky ""professional"" reviewers panning it for it's ""pro-military message and blah blah.   It's not a deep dive into the psyche of the main characters, nor was it ever meant to be.  Can't these uptight politically consumed ""reviewers"" just take a night off from their grievances and just enjoy the action?"
Matthew K,0.5,"Feb 24, 2024","Is this a remake? Or a ""new"" movie? Come on, here."
Cota N,5.0,"Feb 24, 2024","Pure cinema. Tom Cruise does it again. This film had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Intense dogfights, the small character moments, beach volleyball, I loved it all. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are exceptional in the film, and their chemistry was great. The dogfights and training montages are intense and gripping. My expectations were high, and were exceeded. This is a must watch!"
Alec B,3.5,"Feb 21, 2024",A sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way and while this is still very silly in many respect there is also a satisfying emotional arc at play here that feels totally natural.
MATEO R,5.0,"Feb 21, 2024","This movie help that more people wanted to see the original film. And this film: well the acting, the direction, the edition, the soundtrack and of course the plane scenes make this sequel, one of the few sequels better than the original."
Jester T,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Tom Cruise is frankly getting too old for this. A nonstop action movie that was good but the ""love interest"" could be his daughter."
Jade Yasmin H,5.0,"Feb 17, 2024","Nostalgic, amazing shots & heart thumping!"
Alex H,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024","I don't normally say this but this was the best film of 2022. A near masterpiece in action, throwback of story while pushing forward. This summer blockbuster had everything in it."
Blair K,5.0,"Feb 15, 2024",Unreal movie. Just adding another great review to what has become one of my all time fav movies. The casting and writing was spot on.
David v,5.0,"Feb 12, 2024",This was just a fun movie. This is what used to get made that they just stopped making. I would love them to go back to this type of movie.
laughoy4,0.5,"Feb 11, 2024","Horrible story telling, completely fake action, horrendous development. How people found this good was terrifying about movie consumers. Nothing was explained and everything was full of plot holes. Terrible film"
Matt A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece!
The music, the story, the tension, every shot is beautiful and thought through. 
Anyone picking less than 5 stars on this needs their head checking."
Anton A,5.0,"Feb 11, 2024","Straight-forward, fun sequel to Top Gun."
Caligua M,5.0,"Feb 8, 2024",Excellent and highly entertaining.
Jesperi P,4.5,"Feb 1, 2024",Really good. Actually makes you feel you are in the cockpit with an excellent plot and great action.
Music L,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","I'm still amazed at how good this is. That said, Ga GA's track makes me want to puke."
Erinn S,5.0,"Jan 30, 2024","Excellent in every way! The acting, writing, editing, sound, music, production… a perfect movie for drama, action and love. This the 80's happening right now."
Neel B,5.0,"Jan 29, 2024","I went into this film with absolutely no expectations, but I ended up coming out of the theater genuinely believing this is one of the greatest films I've ever witnessed. Actually one of the few films I believe was an IMAX worthy experience. For 98% of films this isn't the case, but the level of audio engineering + cinematography made this an excellent watch, especially the final 40 or so minutes of the film.

A lot of the film is a homage to the old Top Gun, but it doesn't get stuck trying to re-use plotlines/characters from the original film. Instead, they do a magnificent job talking about the themes of integrity, guilt, loyalty, responsibility, brotherhood, loss, and redemption. I won't go into all of them, but the challenges this film addresses on screen puts every character's resolve to the absolute limit. Genuinely a treat to watch this - Tom Cruise with an absolute masterpiece of a production."
Brian G,5.0,"Jan 23, 2024","Rare it happens with sequels, but Maverick is better than the Original. Pulsating action from start to finish"
The Sawyer E,5.0,"Jan 21, 2024","""Top Gun:Maverick"" Is a lot of Fun!!!
Honestly better than the original!! 
Tom Cruise does what he always does.
And he does it good."
Scott B,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","Tom Cruise and Cast did a fantastic job surpassing all expectations for meeting / exceeding ‘Top Gun!' 

Didn't think it would be possible to overcome what has been my favorite movie (all-time), but Cruise pulled it off, & I've already seen the movie 5 times!"
Tom C,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024","This is easily one of the greatest sequels of all time. Absolutely incredible stuff. I saw this movie in cinemas opening night and absolutely loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect. The original Top Gun was an incredible film that shaped many careers and influenced many other films and this movie has done the exact same thing since its release.
It does an incredible job of being faithful to the original while still doing its own thing. There are so many references and callbacks to the original movie but it still tells its own story.
Tom Cruise was very hands on during the production of this movie. He's the lead actor and the producer and he really made this movie what it is. He made all the actors learn how to fly planes because of his dislike of CGI and this movie is so refreshing for that. So many action movies nowadays rely on CGI to tell their stories meanwhile this movie is better than pretty much all of them and has no CGI. It makes the film look and seem so incredibly real and authentic.
Even outside of the incredible action, the characters are all incredibly human and distinct. They're not just rip-offs of characters from the original movie either. And they're played by some incredible actors including Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and Glen Powell.
What an incredible movie and such an amazing sequel."
S A,5.0,"Jan 20, 2024",Awesome; bought and have watched it >12 times.
Jeff,4.5,"Jan 19, 2024","Propoganda goes so hard we don't even want to name the enemy! 

Action is phenomenal. Pure adrenaline for the final mission. 

The cheesy lines are something else at the start."
Sean R,5.0,"Jan 19, 2024","In the contemporary era of hyperbole, ""awesome"" feels somewhat cliché, yet it remains the aptest expression for the unparalleled cinematic journey presented by 'Top Gun: Maverick'. Though the film may not extensively explore groundbreaking territories, it deliberately refrains from fixing what isn't broken. Top Gun: Maverick' stands as an exemplar of cinematic excellence, ranking in this viewers opinion as the finest film ever created."
D F,4.0,"Jan 17, 2024","entertaining, cool, nostalgic"
Marco S,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","An excellent sequel, a must-see movie."
Jack L,5.0,"Jan 17, 2024","Not often these days a film makes you grin in spite of yourself, or get right up on the edge of your seat like at any moment you'll jump up like a crazy person. This is good entertainment."
Nizar N,4.0,"Jan 14, 2024","I agree with those saying that this movie took the essence of its predecessor and added to it. On the one hand it's a relatively different story, involving the many of the same characters of course, but on the other hand it doesn't drift away from the feel of the original movie. The exhilarating action is still there, made better this time by improved visuals and a nice mission. And above all, the story is better than that in its predecessor in aspects such as depth and realism. It's another classic that looks like one from A to Z, and not one of those sequels that ruin the first production by only taking advantage of the name."
Dan W,5.0,"Jan 13, 2024",Greatest movie (maybe) of all time. One of the few instances where the sequel surpasses the original and the original was already a cult classic.  Unbelievable.
br00talbananas,5.0,"Jan 10, 2024","So, SO good. It's got plenty of great acting. Drama, comedy, suspense... Just an excellent movie 💜"
Brenton D,5.0,"Jan 8, 2024","A lot better than I expected from a reboot of a classic movie. It actually left me wanting a 3rd movie to cruise continues to prove he is absolutely one of the best in the business. My only negative remark would be the closing song, the music through the film was upbeat and wouldn't be out of place in the first topgun but having a truly terrible and droning lady gaga song to conclude this masterpiece was disappointing indeed. Skipping the last 2 minutes of this film would be recommended."
Michael P,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",Absolutely favorite movie of the 2022 and even 2023. Maverick knows when to pull the heart strings and when to get your heart rate up. 100% would see it over and over again.
Jack J,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",A feel good movie that will keep you on your feet.
Just Dance B,5.0,"Jan 7, 2024",I LOVE this movie! it has Unexpected shocking scenes and it has happy feeling  when you watch it.
mike f,1.5,"Jan 3, 2024","Yet another example of self glorifying American Exceptionalism.  When another country (besides US) aquires WMDs our military decides to unilaterally defy international law.  For the only country that has used nukes to act so morally superior is the height of hypocrisy, and this silly little flick perpetuates the lies."
MA k,5.0,"Jan 3, 2024",This is movie is the resurrection of Cinema! No wonder it was in theaters for almost a year.

Rainbow C,5.0,"Dec 27, 2023",Great movie from start to finish.
Peter V,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Silly and predictable - hero survives, is lauded and gets the girl. Supporting cast is  weak and action takes are not credible. Escapists - enjoy! :)"

Dennie v,3.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie. Story is good but missing some feelings. The original had some great music. Whenever i hear 'great balls of fire' or 'take my breath away' i'll think back to the original movie. Maverick misses this feel good moments.

Great movie but could be better 😘"
Luke G,5.0,"Dec 26, 2023","Arguably, the best follow-up to its predecessor."
Scott C,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023",Truly a masterpiece and how sequels should be done
Newton C,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","Fantastic, lots of action and great fun, especially for those who like planes. Incredible images. Wonderful shots. Great film to sit back, relax and have fun. In my opinion, it was better than the first one, which was already very good."
Karthik R,4.5,"Dec 25, 2023","Absolute entertainment!! Goes to show just why movies are made and people flock to the theatres. Amazing direction, Superbly hooky script, dialogues are heart wrenching, and the goose bumps come and stay! Bruckhiemer and Tom Cruise have once again, marvelled in the art of film making to show studios and production houses alike, that this is how it should be done! Respect!!"
Clover G,5.0,"Dec 25, 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible and most definitely the best movie of the year. It is inspiring, extremely heart touching and will have you in an array of emotions throughout its duration. The acting is also very good, with great performances from its lead actors. Must watch!"
Matheus A,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023","In an era of very digital action films, this sequel to the 80s classic is a relief and a gift!"
Tyson S,5.0,"Dec 24, 2023",Good old fashioned action packed cinema. Seldom does as sequel top the original movie but Top Gun Maverick manages this in every aspect! Hands down one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
Jamie S,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023","10/10
Surprisingly, one of the best movies of 2022.

9/10 for me is being happy to pay for it at a movie theatre and I saw it twice, so 10/10.

I own it and still pop it on once in a while because it's a movie that keeps you engaged, light and easy to follow while still giving you great moments."
BB I,5.0,"Dec 23, 2023",Old school movie. One of the most enjoyable for quite sometime.
,4.5,"Dec 22, 2023",Much better than the first film
David,4.5,"Dec 21, 2023","Sequels are usually not as good as the originals, but this sequel is at the same level as the original. It kept my eyes on the screen and held my attention well like all great movies do. The action sequences are exciting to watch. The fun ended too soon for me."
Dylan  R,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",I thought it was very intense.
adrianne,5.0,"Dec 20, 2023",its literally so good!! lots of action
Emilliano Jr S,3.0,"Dec 18, 2023",An overated sequel with a slight improvement from the 80's classic.
Cinebuff H,5.0,"Dec 15, 2023","I was born in 89' so I had no idea of Top Gun the original until early mid 90's when Hip Hop songs would reference it and maybe I'd see it somewhere else in pop culture. I say that to say, I watched Maverick with zero context of the past, just let the movie play out on its own with no preconceived notion for what it had to live up to, and it was awesome. I missed the boat of watching it theaters, life happens. Finally watched it, but at home, with a proper 5.1 surround sound and it delivered with the visuals, sfx, and finally acting of course. Every actor came through for their characters, from the OG Hollywood names to the new ones, it all came full circle in a meta kind of way to see them tell the story of time passing. Visually this film delivered in truly putting you into the action. Tom Cruise really shined and brought out the best around him and vice versa. This is going to be my new Christmas movie simply because there's snow, that counts right? Watch and rewatch it! Do yourself a favor and get a quality surround sound, films like these deserve to be played with quality sub woofers."
Chris D,3.5,"Dec 14, 2023","it is Entertaining, the flight sequences are really good. but some of the realism gets me on some of the scenes. but over all it is a good show."
Kevin M,5.0,"Dec 13, 2023",Loved it. Tom Cruise nailed it again.
Melchizedek Franz Noval S,5.0,"Dec 8, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick is an absolute must-see film of 2022, which is a thrill-ride for an outstanding blockbuster to an incredible journey filled with friendship, passion and loyalty. With a great cinematography, visual effects, and a successful acting career for Tom Cruise reprising his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell."
Drew A,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023",Great movie and soundtrack! Classic!
Muhammad Aniq Z,5.0,"Dec 7, 2023","""Top Gun: Maverick"" is totally epic! The flying scenes are insane, and Tom Cruise as Maverick is still super cool. It's like a mix of old-school vibes and crazy new graphics. The whole training scene is intense, and Maverick's character gets even more awesome. They bring in new pilots too, which is pretty cool. The story is kinda easy to anticipate, but who cares when the movie is this much fun? It's like a high-flying tribute to the classic, and you don't wanna miss the ride! Totally would recommend it for a blockbuster movie night with friends!"
St R,5.0,"Dec 6, 2023","I have a running top 10-ish list of movies I love. It's been a LONG time since a new one shot right up high on that list! This film does everything right! It's a US military movie, some will hate that but screw them. No shoehorned social agendas. This is a movie about excellence and service and sacrifice, it's about warriors and what they'll put on the line for each other. And it's about how relationships are what really make us come alive; having someone TO fight FOR is what really matters in the end."
eddiesut13,5.0,"Dec 5, 2023",It's a fun movie to watch. Big visuals and classic songs. A little cheesey at times. Overall what a movie should be. And the third act didn't completely suck like a lot of movies these days.
Schizo V,4.0,"Dec 4, 2023",One of the movies that must be shown in theaters.
,5.0,"Dec 2, 2023","Best combat pilot movie since the original top gun movie. SPOILERS: It finally lays to rest some serious closures from the loss of Goose. I especially love that this pays tribute Val Kilmer. My only fret is the combat mission is very similar to Star Wars A New Hope. Yet at the time and even now - you're on the edge of your seat rooting for Maverick. Also the mission went on without not a single combat death from the good guys - I think the only reason I'm ok with this is because the impossible was pulled off thanks to Maverick. In other words, the whole team surviving is actually a slim possibility that happen. Maverick was shot down at least. Beg there will be a third movie and wish we had other films with the Top Gun - but this movie fills the soul."
Peter F,2.5,"Dec 1, 2023","Honestly so over movies like this. Actors with way too much makeup on, perfect hair, overly dramatized script, predictable storyline. Bleh. I'd recommend it as a watch just because I'm a cinefile and will watch almost anything once. But I wish Tom Cruise and other Hollywood folks would stop making dumb movies like this."
Benjiboy t,5.0,"Nov 29, 2023",Might be the best movie since Top Gun
Zaya G,5.0,"Nov 27, 2023",Amazing and thrilling moving. Great directing by Joseph Kosinski!
Andy H,5.0,"Nov 22, 2023","Movie of the year ofc, excited to see more!"
Steve D,1.5,"Nov 19, 2023",Fans of the first will find a lot to like but it covers nothing new.
JT H,4.0,"Nov 19, 2023","This movie was pretty solid. I don't think it's as good as most people say, but it's good. The action is amazing, and Tom Cruise is fantastic."
CJ S,1.5,"Nov 18, 2023",Just no. Couldn't get through the first 20 minutes. Boring. Bad acting.
wilson s,5.0,"Nov 17, 2023","It does not matter if you haven't seen the original beforehand, all the information you need is covered very quickly. And while there is a mission and an intriguing plot with twists, the main strength is it's outstanding execution of it's characters. It evaded politics and instead had every character navigate each other's personalities, agendas, and past. The story between Goose's son and Maverick is interesting and by the end, very wholesome. Surprisingly fantastic movie!"
Cullen L,5.0,"Nov 15, 2023",Its a Great movie. One of the best!
Daniel D,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023","like I said at the first movie, bro has beef with the hard deck"
Benjamin E,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",A movie made purely for the purpose of entertainment.  A refreshing change from most movies that being used as a pulpit to lecture audiences about political issues. This one doesn't get political.  People from all walks of life will be entertained and not lectured. No politics in this. It truly is a crowd pleaser
Landon S,5.0,"Nov 14, 2023",An absolute cinematic masterpiece
Ray C,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023",Tom Cruises performance was amazing and the roll fits him perfectly. Loved how much everyone is developed and changes throughout the movie. Great cgi
matthias s,5.0,"Nov 9, 2023","Top Gun maverick is an action-packed, high-octane adrenaline rush that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. It's a perfect blend of action, romance, and drama that will have you hooked from start to finish.

Firstly, the cinematography is simply breathtaking. The stunning aerial footage of fighter planes soaring through the sky is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the sound effects will have you feeling like you're right in the middle of the action.

The acting is incredible, with Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance as the cocky, yet talented Maverick. His chemistry with Miles Teller, who plays Rooster, is electric and adds an emotional depth to the film.

Top Gun Maverick is a true masterpiece of its genre and a must-watch for any movie lover. It's an epic adventure that will leave you feeling exhilarated and wanting more."
Parker N,5.0,"Nov 8, 2023","I was not alive for then the first one came out so when we saw this second weekend of it coming out, I really loved this movie. It did a good job, without explicitly telling you everything, about what happened in the first, so you don't feel so lost. As someone who never saw the first one, this was a very, very great movie."
Marc Joseph K,5.0,"Nov 6, 2023",Tom Cruise Nailed It!
Chase C,4.5,"Nov 5, 2023","This movie is amazing, and it is WAY better than the original in my opinion. My only issue is that the romance feels pretty forced and it genuinely adds nothing to the movie."
Chris A,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023",Formulaic and predictable and all of that...as well as a total blast. It hit every note just like a great piece of music I want to sing along to. It knew I knew and we still had fun together.
Pablo R,5.0,"Nov 3, 2023","Increíble, una de las mejores películas del 2023 y quizá de la historia, la trama, música, desarrollo de los personajes, todo es increíble, digno de verse en pantalla IMAX o acompañar de un buen sonido en casa"

Daniela P,0.5,"Oct 23, 2023","I've seen this movie countless times in the form of the typical brainwashing Hollywood cliches, but I have to admit that the ending was so dumb, that for a moment I thought that it turns the movie to some kind of a parody of these cliches. The critics' evaluation of 96% is beyond my understanding, I wouldn't give more than 10% to this total waste of time."
CK Movie Reviews,5.0,"Oct 21, 2023","Top Gun: Maverick did everything right. enhances action sequences, better character development, a compelling story and higher stakes."

Jonathan L,5.0,"Oct 20, 2023","I saw this 3 times at the cinema because I simply couldn't get enough. It is edge of your seat exciting. With heavy doses of nostalgia and Star Wars mixed in. Highly recommended, I loved every second. This is what can be accomplished when you care about the original IP and build on it from the position of loving what came before."
Ronald  R,5.0,"Oct 19, 2023",Great Movie!!! Highly Recommended!!! A++ 🍿🎥🍿
,4.5,"Oct 17, 2023","Intense and a blast! I honestly thought this one was better than the first. The first one is a glorified love story and this one was packed full of action. By the time the final fight comes around, it leaves you on the edge of your seat ready to rock and roll!"

Ronan D,5.0,"Oct 10, 2023",It's extremely rare for a sequel to surpass its predecessor. Top Gun Maverick soars higher than the first. This proves that Tom Cruise can save Hollywood.

K,1.0,"Oct 8, 2023","Total BS plot.  Fake flying   Fake bar, fake military uniforms. Just over it's junk. No way our military would act like there's only one option and make it all depend on one person. Plus Cruise treats our military like garbage and that they should cater to him."
Joo L,5.0,"Oct 8, 2023","Top Gun Maverick era pra ser considerado um elogio de tão bom que ele é, simplesmente incrível o trabalho que nele foi feito, Tom Cruise realmente leva a muito serio a qualidade em seus filmes, um filme emocionante e com cenas de fazer você ficar na ponta da cadeira, 9,8 fácil para está obra."
Vic T,5.0,"Oct 6, 2023",What an outstanding sequel. The kind of sequel the original movie deserved. Congratulations to everyone involved. I guess there are still people who knows what an action movie is about.

c c,1.5,"Oct 2, 2023","This was clearly made by diversity hires.  The writing and story are awful.  They make some bs mission with bs details.  is this really worth what they're doing?  don't even get me started on the romance part of the movie.  I had to skip before i died of cringe. 

I'm not saying the first one was good but it clearly had some brain cells behind it, where this one was, lacking."
Annis,5.0,"Oct 1, 2023",One of the best movie i have seen. Loved it !!!
Luke M,5.0,"Oct 1, 2023","Tom Cruise reprises his role perfectly in this modern-day throwback to the blockbuster movies that we all loved from the 80's.
The film is a breath of fresh air when compared to the stale movie writing that has churned out of Hollywood throughout the last decade. It hits all of the highs that you'd expect of a Tom Cruise blockbuster and still has time for a well thought out sequel with great storytelling.
Thrilling action, breathtaking effects, enviable character development and plot.
This was definitely the best film of the year by a long way!"
Mark,3.5,"Sep 30, 2023",IT's mostly what I expected ... Too bad it took so long to get here

,5.0,"Sep 17, 2023",Didn’t think it would be possible to make a good sequel to the first. I was wrong. Just enough tie in to the original and yet still it’s own movie. A level of predictability is present. If this is a major issue you should probably choose another genre.
Cali T,5.0,"Sep 14, 2023","Disney and hollywood needs to take some notes. Reviving/continuing old movies means you need to reference and nod to the classics before it, which TG:Mav did and continued to extend the story. The story was smart not to mix politics (didn't mention where the enemies are from). That's why the film did extremely well and got paid billions. Pay the fan's service, and they'll pay you in box office sales. Simple math."
